                    Several planets in the Solar System<br/>

                    The nearest star to Earth is the Sun.<br/>
                    Other stars are visible from Earth<br/>
                    during the night,<br/>
                    appearing as a multitude<br/>
                    of fixed luminous points<br/>
                    in the sky due to their immense<br/>
                    distance from Earth.<br/>
                    Historically, the most prominent stars<br/>
                    were grouped into constellations and asterisms,<br/>
                    and the brightest stars gained proper names.

                    body that orbits another body<br/>
                    (a planet, dwarf planet,<br/>

                    6 planetary satellite systems.<br/>

                    interstellar gas and dust, and dark matter.<br/>
                    Galaxies are categorized<br/>

                    including elliptical, spiral, and irregular.<br/>
                    Many galaxies are thought to have<br/>
                    black holes at their active centers.<br/>
                    The Milky Way's central black hole,<br/>

                <p class="homeBoxTitle">Constellations</p>
                <p>In modern astronomy, a constellation<br/>
                    is a specific area of the celestial sphere<br/>
                    as defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).<br/>
                    These areas had their origins in Western-traditional<br/>
                    asterisms from which the constellations take their names.<br/>
                    There are 88 officially recognized constellations,<br/>
                    covering the entire sky.<br/>
                    Thus, any given point in a celestial coordinate system<br/>
                    can unambiguously be assigned to a constellation.<br/>
                    It is usual in astronomy to give the constellation<br/>
                    in which a given object is found along with its coordinates<br/>
                    in order to convey a rough idea in which part of the sky it is located.</p>

                    Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly,<br/>
                    the largest eight are the planets,<br/>
                    with the remainder being significantly smaller objects,<br/>
