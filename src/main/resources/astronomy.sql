(1, 'Canis Major', 'Canis Major /ˌkeɪnɨs ˈmeɪdʒər/ is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere. In the second century, it was included in Ptolemy''s 48 constellations, and is counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for "greater dog" in contrast to Canis Minor, the "lesser dog"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of Orion the hunter through the sky. The Milky Way passes through Canis Major and several open clusters lie within its borders, most notably M41.<p> Canis Major contains Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, known as the "dog star". It is bright because of its proximity to our Solar System. In contrast, the other bright stars of the constellation are stars of great distance and high luminosity. At magnitude 1.5, Epsilon Canis Majoris (Adhara) is the second brightest star of the constellation and the brightest source of extreme ultraviolet radiation in the night sky. Next in brightness are the yellow-white supergiant Delta (Wezen) at 1.8, the blue-white giant Beta (Mirzam) at 2.0, blue-white supergiants Eta (Aludra) at 2.4 and Omicron1 at 3.0, and white spectroscopic binary Zeta (Furud), also at 3.0. The red hypergiant VY Canis Majoris is one of the largest stars known, while the neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 has a radius of a mere 5 km.</p>', '380 sq. deg.

It is one of 48 listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and is one of the 88 constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. Lyra was often represented on star maps as a vulture or an eagle carrying a lyre, and hence sometimes referred to as Aquila Cadens or Vultur Cadens. Beginning at the north, Lyra is bordered by Draco, Hercules, Vulpecula, and Cygnus. Lyra is visible from the northern hemisphere from spring through autumn, and nearly overhead, in temperate latitudes, during the summer months. From the southern hemisphere, it is visible low in the northern sky during the winter months.\r\n\r\n<p>The lucida or brightest star—and one of the brightest stars in the sky—is the white main sequence star Vega, a corner of the Summer Triangle. Beta Lyrae is the prototype of a class of stars known as Beta Lyrae variables, binary stars so close to each other that they become egg-shaped and material flows from one to the other.

(4, 'Orion', 'Orion is a prominent constellation located on the celestial equator and visible throughout the world. It is one of the most conspicuous and recognizable constellations in the night sky. It was named after Orion, a hunter in Greek mythology. Its brightest stars are Rigel (Beta Orionis) and Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis), a blue-white and a red supergiant, respectively.\r\nThe earliest depiction that has been linked to the constellation of Orion is a prehistoric (Aurignacian) mammoth ivory carving found in a cave in the Ach valley in Germany in 1979. Archaeologists have estimated it to have been fashioned approximately 32,000 to 38,000 years ago. The distinctive pattern of Orion has been recognized in numerous cultures around the world, and many myths have been associated with it. It has also been used as a symbol in the modern world.\r\n<p>The Babylonian star catalogues of the Late Bronze Age name Orion <sup>MUL</sup>SIPA.ZI.AN.NA, "The Heavenly Shepherd" or "True Shepherd of Anu" - Anu being the chief god of the heavenly realms. The Babylonian constellation was sacred to Papshukal and Ninshubur, both minor gods fulfilling the role of ''messenger to the gods''. Papshukal was closely associated with the figure of a walking bird on Babylonian boundary stones, and on the star map the figure of the Rooster was located below and behind the figure of the True Shepherd—both constellations represent the herald of the gods, in his bird and human forms respectively.</p>\r\n<p>In ancient Egypt, the stars of Orion were regarded as a god, called Sah. Because Orion rises before Sirius, the star whose heliacal rising was the basis for the Solar Egyptian calendar, Sah was closely linked with Sopdet, the goddess who personified Sirius. The god Sopdu was said to be the son of Sah and Sopdet. Sah was syncretized with Osiris, while Sopdet was syncretized with Osiris'' mythological wife, Isis. In the Pyramid Texts, from the 24th and 23rd centuries BC, Sah was one of many gods whose form the dead pharaoh was said to take in the afterlife.</p>\r\n<p>The Armenians identified their legendary patriarch and founder Hayk with Orion. Hayk is also the name of the Orion constellation in the Armenian translation of the Bible.</p>\r\n<p>The Bible mentions Orion three times, naming it "Kesil" (כסיל, literally - fool). Though, this name perhaps is etymologically connected with "Kislev", the name for the ninth month of the Hebrew calendar (i.e. November–December), which, in turn, may derive from the Hebrew root K-S-L as in the words "kesel, kisla" (כֵּסֶל, כִּסְלָה, hope, positiveness), i.e. hope for winter rains.): Job 9:9 ("He is the maker of the Bear and Orion"), Job 38:31 ("Can you loosen Orion''s belt?"), and Amos 5:8 ("He who made the Pleiades and Orion").\r\nIn ancient Aram, the constellation was known as N<sup>e</sup>phîlā′, the Nephilim may have been Orion''s descendants.</P>', '594 sq. deg.

(5, 'Taurus', 'Taurus (Latin for "the Bull"; symbol: Taurus.svg, Unicode: ♉) is one of the constellations of the zodiac, which means it is crossed by the plane of the ecliptic. Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere''s winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the Early Bronze Age when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring equinox. Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced various bull figures in the mythologies of Ancient Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylon, Egypt, Greece, and Rome.\r\n<p>There are a number of features of interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, both of which are visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into the northern part of the constellation.

(6, 'Scorpius', 'Scorpius is one of the constellations of the zodiac. Its name is Latin for scorpion, and its symbol is Scorpio.svg (Unicode ♏). It lies between Libra to the west and Sagittarius to the east. It is a large constellation located in the southern hemisphere near the center of the Milky Way.\r\n<p>Scorpius contains many bright stars, including Antares (α Sco), "rival of Mars," so named because of its distinct reddish hue; β<sup>1</sup> Sco (Graffias or Acrab), a triple star; δ Sco (Dschubba, "the forehead"); θ Sco (Sargas, of unknown origin); ν Sco (Jabbah); ξ Sco (Girtab, "the scorpion"); π Sco (Iclil); σ Sco (Alniyat); and τ Sco (also known as Alniyat, "the arteries").</p>\r\n<p>Marking the tip of the scorpion''s curved tail are λ Sco (Shaula) and υ Sco (Lesath), whose names both mean "sting." Given their proximity to one another, λ Sco and υ Sco are sometimes referred to as the Cat''s Eyes.</p>\r\n<p>The constellation''s bright stars form a pattern like a longshoreman''s hook. Most of them are massive members of the nearest OB association: Scorpius-Centaurus.</p>\r\n<p>The star δ Sco, after having been a stable 2.3 magnitude star, flared in July 2000 to 1.9 in a matter of weeks. It has since become a variable star fluctuating between 2.0 and 1.6. This means that at its brightest it is the second brightest star in Scorpius.</p>\r\n<p>U Scorpii is the fastest known nova with a period of about 10 years.\r\nω¹ Scorpii and ω² Scorpii are an optical double, which can be resolved by the unaided eye. They have contrasting blue and yellow colours.</p>\r\n<p>The star once designated γ Sco (despite being well within the boundaries of Libra) is today known as σ Lib. Moreover, the entire constellation of Libra was considered to be claws of Scorpius (Chelae Scorpionis) in Ancient Greek times, with a set of scales held aloft by Astraea (represented by adjacent Virgo) being formed from these western-most stars during later Greek times.

(7, 'Gemini', 'Gemini is one of the constellations of the zodiac. It was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. Its name is Latin for "twins," and it is associated with the twins Castor and Pollux in Greek mythology. Its symbol is (Unicode ♊).\r\n<p>Gemini lies between Taurus to the west and Cancer to the east, with Auriga and Lynx to the north and Monoceros and Canis Minor to the south.\r\nThe Sun resides in the astrological sign of Gemini from June 20 to July 20 each year (though the zodiac dates it May 21 - June 21). By mid August, Gemini will appear along the eastern horizon in the morning sky prior to sunrise. The best time to observe Gemini at night is overhead during the months of January and February. By April and May, the constellation will be visible soon after sunset in the west.</p>\r\n<p>The easiest way to locate the constellation is to find its two brightest stars Castor and Pollux eastward from the familiar “V” shaped asterism of Taurus and the three stars of Orion’s belt. Another way is to mentally draw a line from the Pleiades star cluster located in Taurus and the brightest star in Leo, Regulus. In doing so, you are drawing an imaginary line that is relatively close to the ecliptic, a line which intersects Gemini roughly at the midpoint of the constellation, just below Castor and Pollux.</p>', '514 sq. deg.

The swan is one of the most recognizable constellations of the northern summer and autumn, it features a prominent asterism known as the Northern Cross (in contrast to the Southern Cross). Cygnus was among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.\r\n\r\n<p>Cygnus contains Deneb, one of the brightest stars in the night sky and one corner of the Summer Triangle, as well as some notable X-ray sources and the giant stellar association of Cygnus OB2. One of the stars of this association, NML Cygni, is one of the largest stars currently known. The constellation is also home to Cygnus X-1, a distant X-ray binary containing a supergiant and unseen massive companion that was the first object widely held to be a black hole. Many star systems in Cygnus have known planets as a result of the Kepler Mission observing one patch of the sky, the patch is the area around Cygnus. In addition, most of the eastern part of Cygnus is dominated by the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall, a giant galaxy filament that is the largest known structure in the observable universe; covering most of the northern sky.</p>', '804 sq. deg.

(9, 'Auriga', 'Auriga is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Located north of the celestial equator, its name is the Latin word for "charioteer", associating it with various mythological charioteers, including Erichthonius and Myrtilus. Auriga is most prominent during winter evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with the five other constellations that have stars in the Winter Hexagon asterism. Because of its northern declination, Auriga is only visible in its entirety as far as 34° south; for observers farther south it lies partially or fully below the horizon. A large constellation, with an area of 657 square degrees, it is half the size of the largest constellation, Hydra.\r\n<p>Its brightest star, Capella, is an unusual multiple star system among the brightest stars in the night sky. Beta Aurigae is an interesting variable star in the constellation; Epsilon Aurigae, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the variable star AE Aurigae.</p>\r\n<p>In Chinese mythology, Auriga''s stars were incorporated into several constellations, including the celestial emperors'' chariots, made up of the modern constellation''s brightest stars.

It is the sixth largest of the modern constellations.\r\n<p>At its southern end is the magnitude 0.5 star Achernar, designated Alpha Eridani. 144 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white hued main sequence star whose traditional name means "the river''s end". Achernar is a very peculiar star because it is one of the flattest stars known. Observations indicate that its radius is about 50% larger at the equator than at the poles. This distortion occurs because the star is spinning extremely rapidly.</p>\r\n<p>There are several other noteworthy stars in Eridanus, including some double stars. Beta Eridani, traditionally called Cursa, is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.8, 89 light-years from Earth. Its place to the south of Orion''s foot gives it its name, which means "the footstool". Theta Eridani, called Acamar, is a binary star with blue-white components, distinguishable in small amateur telescopes and 161 light-years from Earth. The primary is of magnitude 3.2 and the secondary is of magnitude 4.3. 32 Eridani is a binary star 290 light-years from Earth.

The primary is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 4.9 and the secondary is of magnitude 8. 40 Eridani is a triple star system consisting of an orange main-sequence star, a white dwarf, and a red dwarf. The orange main-sequence star is the primary of magnitude 4.4, and the white secondary of magnitude 9.5 is the most easily visible white dwarf. The red dwarf, of magnitude 11, orbits the white dwarf every 250 years.

(11, 'Draco', 'Draco is a constellation in the far northern sky. Its name is Latin for dragon. Draco is circumpolar (that is, never setting) for many observers in the northern hemisphere. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. The north pole of the ecliptic is in Draco. Draco can be seen all year from northern latitudes.\r\n<p>Thuban (α Draconis) was the northern pole star from 3942 BC, when it moved farther north than Theta Boötis, until 1793 BC. The Egyptian Pyramids were designed to have one side facing north, with an entrance passage designed so that Thuban would be visible at night. Due to the effects of precession, it will once again be the pole star around the year 21000 AD. It is a blue-white giant star of magnitude 3.7, 309 light-years from Earth. The traditional name of Alpha Draconis, Thuban, means "head of the serpent".</p>\r\n<p>There are two other stars above magnitude 3 in Draco. The brighter of the two—and the brightest star in Draco—is Gamma Draconis, traditionally called Etamin or Eltanin. It is an orange giant star of magnitude 2.2, 148 light-years from Earth. The aberration of starlight was discovered in 1728 when James Bradley observed Gamma Draconis. Beta Draconis, traditionally called Rastaban, is a yellow giant star of magnitude 2.8, 362 light-years from Earth. Its name shares a meaning with Thuban, "head of the serpent".</p>\r\n<p>Draco is home to several double stars and binary stars. η Draconis is a double star with a yellow-hued primary of magnitude 2.8 and a white-hued secondary of magnitude 8.2 located south of the primary. The two are separated by 4.8 arcseconds. Mu Draconis, traditionally called Alrakis, is a binary star with two white components. Magnitude 5.6 and 5.7, the two components orbit each other every 670 years. The Alrakis system is 88 light-years from Earth. Nu Draconis is a similar binary star with two white components, 100 light-years from Earth. Both components are of magnitude 4.9 and can be distinguished in a small amateur telescope or a pair of binoculars. Omicron Draconis is a double star divisible in small telescopes. The primary is an orange giant of magnitude 4.6, 322 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 7.8. Psi Draconis is a binary star divisible in binoculars and small amateur telescopes, 72 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow-white star of magnitude 4.6 and the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 5.8. 16 Draconis and 17 Draconis are part of a triple star 400 light-years from Earth, divisible in medium-sized amateur telescopes. The primary, a blue-white star of magnitude 5.1, is itself a binary with components of magnitude 5.4 and 6.5. The secondary is of magnitude 5.5 and the system is 400 light-years away. 20 Draconis is a binary star with a white-hued primary of magnitude 7.1 and a yellow-hued secondary of magnitude 7.3 located east-northeast of the primary. The two are separated by 1.2 arcseconds at their maximum and have an orbital period of 420 years. As of 2012, the two components are approaching their maximum separation. 39 Draconis is a triple star 188 light-years from Earth, divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue star of magnitude 5.0, the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 7.4, and the tertiary is a star of magnitude 8.0; the tertiary appears to be a close companion to the primary. 40 Draconis and 41 Draconis are a binary star divisible in small telescopes. The two orange dwarf stars are 170 light-years from Earth and are of magnitude 5.7 and 6.1.\r\nR Draconis is a red Mira-type variable star with a period of about 8 months. Its average minimum magnitude is approximately 12.4, and its average maximum magnitude is approximately 7.6. It was discovered to be a variable star by Hans Geelmuyden in 1876.</p>\r\n<p>The constellation contains the star recently named Kepler-10 which has been confirmed to be orbited by Kepler-10b, the smallest ever rocky Earth-sized planet detected outside of our solar system.</p>', '1083 sq. deg.

(12, 'Dorado', 'Dorado /dɒˈreɪdoʊ/ is a constellation in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), which is known as dorado in Portuguese, although it has also been depicted as a swordfish. Dorado is notable for containing most of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the remainder being in the constellation Mensa. The South ecliptic pole also lies within this constellation.\r\n<p>Even though the name Dorado is not Latin but Portuguese, astronomers give it the Latin genitive form Doradus when naming its stars; they are treating it (like the adjacent constellation Argo Navis) as if it were a feminine proper name of Greek origin ending in -ō (like Io or Callisto or Argo), names that have a genitive ending in -ūs.</p>\r\n<p>Dorado was one of twelve constellations named by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, and it first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. Its first depiction in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer''s Uranometria of 1603 where it was also named Dorado. Dorado has been represented historically as a dolphinfish and a swordfish; the latter depiction is inaccurate. It has also been represented as a goldfish. The constellation was also known in the 17th and 18th century as Xiphias, the swordfish, first attested in Johannes Kepler''s edition of Tycho Brahe''s star list in the Rudolphine Tables of 1627. The name Dorado ultimately become dominant and was adopted by the IAU.</p>', '179 sq. deg.

(13, 'Aquarius', 'Aquarius is a constellation of the zodiac, situated between Capricornus and Pisces. Its name is Latin for "water-carrier" or "cup-carrier", and its symbol is Aquarius.svg (Unicode ♒), a representation of water.\r\n<p>Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac (the sun''s apparent path). It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is found in a region often called the Sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as Cetus the whale, Pisces the fish, and Eridanus the river.</p>\r\n<p>Aquarius is identified as GU.LA "The Great One" in the Babylonian star catalogues and represents the god Ea himself, who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase. The Babylonian star-figure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium. It contained the winter solstice in the Early Bronze Age. In Old Babylonian astronomy, Ea was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the Sun''s path, the "Way of Ea", corresponding to the period of 45 days on either side of winter solstice. Aquarius was also associated with the destructive floods that the Babylonians regularly experienced, and thus was negatively connoted. In Ancient Egypt, Aquarius was associated with the annual flood of the Nile; the banks were said to flood when Aquarius put his jar into the river, beginning spring.</p>\r\n<p>In the Greek tradition, the constellation became represented as simply a single vase from which a stream poured down to Piscis Austrinus. The name in the Hindu zodiac is likewise kumbha "water-pitcher", showing that the zodiac reached India via Greek intermediaries.</p>\r\n<p>In Greek mythology, Aquarius is sometimes associated with Deucalion, the son of Prometheus who built a ship with his wife Pyrrha to survive an imminent flood. They sailed for nine days before washing ashore on Mount Parnassus. Aquarius is also sometimes identified with beautiful Ganymede, a youth in Greek mythology and the son of Trojan king Tros, who was taken to Mount Olympus by Zeus to act as cup-carrier to the gods. Neighboring Aquila represents the eagle, under Zeus'' command, that snatched the young boy; some versions of the myth indicate that the eagle was in fact Zeus transformed. An alternative version of the tale recounts Ganymede''s kidnapping by the goddess of the dawn, Eos, motivated by her affection for young men; Zeus then stole him from Eos and employed him as cup-bearer. Yet another figure associated with the water bearer is Cecrops I, a king of Athens who sacrificed water instead of wine to the gods.</p>', '980 sq. deg.

(14, 'Camelopardalis', 'Camelopardalis /kəˌmɛləˈpɑrdəlɨs/ or the Giraffe constellation is a large, faint grouping of stars in the northern sky. The constellation was introduced in 1612 (or 1613) by Petrus Plancius. Some older astronomy books give an alternative spelling of the name, Camelopardus.\r\n<p>First attested in English in 1785, the word camelopardalis comes from Latin, and it is the romanisation of the Greek "καμηλοπάρδαλις" meaning "giraffe", from "κάμηλος" (kamēlos), "camel" + "πάρδαλις" (pardalis), "leopard", due to its having a long neck like a camel and spots like a leopard.</p>\r\n<p>Camelopardalis is in the part of the celestial sphere facing away from the galactic plane. Accordingly, many distant galaxies are visible within its borders. NGC 2403 is a galaxy in the M81 group of galaxies, located approximately 12 million light-years from Earth with a redshift of 0.00043. It is classified as being between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy because it has faint arms and a large central bulge. NGC 2403 was first discovered by the 18th century astronomer William Herschel, who was working in England at the time. It has an integrated magnitude of 8.0 and is approximately 0.25° long.</p>\r\n<p>NGC 1502 is a magnitude 6.9 open cluster about 3,000 light years from Earth. It has about 45 bright members, and features a double star of magnitude 7.0 at its center. NGC 1502 is also associated with Kemble''s Cascade, a simple but beautiful asterism appearing in the sky as a chain of stars 2.5° long that is parallel to the Milky Way and is pointed towards Cassiopeia. NGC 1501 is a planetary nebula located roughly 1.4° south of NGC 1502.</p>\r\n<p>NGC 2655 is a small galaxy. IC 342 is one of the brightest two galaxies in the IC 342/Maffei Group of galaxies. The dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1569 is a magnitude 11.9 starburst galaxy, about 11 million light years away.</p>\r\n<p>MS0735.6+7421 is a galaxy cluster with a redshift of 0.216, located 2.6 billion light-years from Earth. It is unique for its intracluster medium, which emits x-rays at a very high rate. This galaxy cluster features two cavities 600,000 light-years in diameter, caused by its central supermassive black hole, which emits jets of matter. MS0735.6+7421 is one of the largest and most distant examples of this phenomenon.</p>\r\n<p>Tombaugh 5 is a fairly dim open cluster in Camelopardalis. It has an overall magnitude of 8.4 and is located 5,800 light-years from Earth. It is a Shapley class c and Trumpler class III 1 r cluster, meaning that it is irregularly shaped and appears loose. Though it is detached from the star field, it is not concentrated at its center at all. It has more than 100 stars which do not vary widely in brightness, mostly being of the 15th and 16th magnitude.</p>\r\n<p>NGC 2146 is an 11th magnitude barred spiral starburst galaxy conspicuously warped by interaction with a neighbour.</p>\r\n<p>MACS0647-JD, one of the possible candidates for the farthest known galaxies in the universe (z= 10.7), is also in Camelopardalis.</p>', '757 sq. deg.

(15, 'Hydra', 'Hydra is the largest of the 88 modern constellations, measuring 1303 square degrees. Also one of the longest at over 100 degrees, its southern end abuts Libra and Centaurus and its northern end borders Cancer. It has a long history, having been included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. It is commonly represented as a water snake. It should not be confused with the similarly named constellation of Hydrus.\r\n<p>Despite its size, Hydra contains only one reasonably bright star, Alphard, designated Alpha Hydrae. It is an orange giant of magnitude 2.0, 177 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means "the solitary one". Beta Hydrae is a blue-white star of magnitude 4.3, 365 light-years from Earth. Gamma Hydrae is a yellow giant of magnitude 3.0, 132 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Hydra has one bright binary star, Epsilon Hydrae, which is difficult to split in amateur telescopes; it has a period of 1000 years and is 135 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 3.4 and the secondary is a blue star of magnitude 6.7. However, there are several dimmer double stars and binary stars in Hydra. 27 Hydrae is a triple star with two components visible in binoculars and three visible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a white star of magnitude 4.8, 244 light-years from Earth. The secondary, a binary star, appears in binoculars at magnitude 7.0 but is composed of a magnitude 7 and a magnitude 11 star; it is 202 light-years from Earth. 54 Hydrae is a binary star 99 light-years from Earth, easily divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 5.3 and the secondary is a purple star of magnitude 7.4. N Hydrae (N Hya) is a pair of stars of magnitudes 5.8 and 5.9. Struve 1270 (Σ1270) consists of a pair of stars, magnitudes 6.4 and 7.4.</p>\r\n<p>The other main named star in Hydra is Sigma, σ, Hydrae, which also has the name of Minaruja, from the Arabic for snake''s nose. At magnitude 4.54, it is rather dim. The head of the snake corresponds to the Āshleshā nakshatra, the lunar zodiacal constellation in Indian astronomy.</p>\r\n<p>Hydra is also home to several variable stars. R Hydrae is a Mira variable star 2000 light-years from Earth; it is one of the brightest Mira variables at its maximum of magnitude 3.5. It has a minimum magnitude of 10 and a period of 390 days. V Hydrae is an unusually vivid red variable star 20,000 light-years from Earth. It varies in magnitude from a minimum of 9.0 to a maximum of 6.6. Along with its notable color, V Hydrae is also home to at least two exoplanets. U Hydrae is a semi-regular variable star with a deep red color, 528 light-years from Earth. It has a minimum magnitude of 6.6 and a maximum magnitude of 4.2; its period is 115 days.</p>\r\n<p>The constellation also contains the radio source Hydra A.</p>', '1303 sq. deg.

(16, 'Cetus', 'Cetus /ˈsiːtəs/ is a constellation. Its name refers to Cetus, a sea monster in Greek mythology, although it is often called ''the whale'' today. Cetus is located in the region of the sky that contains other water-related constellations such as Aquarius, Pisces, and Eridanus.\r\n<p>Although Cetus is not generally considered part of the zodiac, the ecliptic passes less than a quarter of a degree from its constellation boundary, and thus the moon, planets, and even part of the sun may be in Cetus for brief periods of time. This is all the more true of asteroids, since their orbits usually have a greater inclination to the ecliptic than the moon and planets. For example, the asteroid 4 Vesta was discovered in this constellation in 1807.\r\nThe most notable star in Cetus is Mira ("the Wonderful"), designated Omicron Ceti, the first variable star to be discovered and the prototype of its class. Over a period of 332 days it reaches a maximum apparent magnitude of 3 - visible to the naked eye - and dips to a minimum magnitude of 10, invisible to the unaided eye. Its seeming appearance and disappearance gave it its common name, which means "the amazing one". Mira pulsates with a minimum size of 400 solar diameters and a maximum size of 500 solar diameters. 420 light-years from Earth, it was discovered by David Fabricius in 1596.</p>\r\n<p>There are several other bright stars in Cetus. α Ceti, traditionally called Menkar ("the nose"), is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 2.5, 220 light-years from Earth. It is a wide double star; the secondary is 93 Ceti, a blue-white hued star of magnitude 5.6, 440 light-years away. β Ceti, also called Deneb Kaitos and Diphda, is the brightest star in Cetus. It is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 2.0, 96 light-years from Earth. The traditional name "Deneb Kaitos" means "the whale''s tail". γ Ceti, Kaffaljidhma ("head of the whale") is a very close double star. The primary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 3.5, 82 light-years from Earth, and the secondary is a blue-hued star of magnitude 6.6. Tau Ceti, or Durre Menthor, is noted for being the nearest Sun-like star at a distance of 11.9 light-years. It is a yellow-hued main-sequence star of magnitude 3.5.</p>\r\n<p>AA Ceti is a triple star system; the brightest member has a magnitude of 6.2. The primary and secondary are separated by 8.4 arcseconds at an angle of 304 degrees. The tertiary is not visible in telescopes. AA Ceti is an eclipsing variable star; the tertiary star passes in front of the primary and causes the system''s apparent magnitude to decrease by 0.5 magnitudes. UV Ceti is an unusual binary variable star. 8.7 light-years from Earth, the system consists of two red dwarfs. both of magnitude 13. One of the stars is a flare star, which are prone to sudden, random outbursts that last several minutes; these increase the pair''s apparent brightness significantly - as high as magnitude 7.\r\n<p>Cetus lies far from the galactic plane, so that many distant galaxies are visible, unobscured by dust from the Milky Way. Of these, the brightest is Messier 77 (NGC 1068), a 9th magnitude spiral galaxy near Delta Ceti. It appears face-on and has a clearly visible nucleus of magnitude 10. About 50 million light-years from Earth, M77 is also a Seyfert galaxy and thus a bright object in the radio spectrum.

(17, 'Centaurus', '<p>Centaurus /sɛnˈtɔrəs/ is a bright constellation in the southern sky. One of the largest constellations, Centaurus was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. In Greek mythology, Centaurus represents a centaur; a creature that is half human, half horse (another constellation named after a centaur is one from the zodiac: Sagittarius). Notable stars include Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to our own Solar System, its neighbour in the sky Beta Centauri, and V766 Centauri, one of the largest stars yet discovered. The constellation also contains Omega Centauri, the brightest globular cluster as visible from Earth and one of the largest known.</p>\r\n<p>Centaurus contains several very bright stars because of its position in the Milky Way; in addition, its alpha and beta stars are used to find the constellation Crux. The constellation has 281 stars above magnitude 6.5, meaning that they are visible to the unaided eye, the most of any constellation. Alpha Centauri, the closest star to the Sun, has a high proper motion; it will be a mere half-degree from Beta Centauri in approximately 4000 years.</p>\r\n<p>Alpha Centauri is a triple star system that contains Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun. Traditionally called Rigil Kentaurus or Toliman, meaning "foot of the centaur", the system has an overall magnitude of -0.28 and is 4.4 light-years from Earth. The primary and secondary are both yellow-hued stars; the primary, is of magnitude -0.01 and the secondary is of magnitude 1.35. Proxima, the tertiary star, is a red dwarf of magnitude 11.0; it is almost 2 degrees away from the primary and secondary and has a period of approximately one million years. Also a flare star, Proxima has minutes-long outbursts where it brightens by over a magnitude. The primary and secondary have a period of 80 years and will be closest to each other as seen from Earth in 2037 and 2038.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to Alpha Centauri (the 3rd brightest star in the sky), a second first magnitude star, Beta Centauri, is part of Centaurus. Also called Hadar and Agena, Beta Centauri is a double star; the primary is a blue-hued giant star of magnitude 0.6, 525 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 4.0 and has a very small separation. A bright binary star in Centaurus is Gamma Centauri, which appears to the naked eye at magnitude 2.2. The primary and secondary are both blue-white hued stars of magnitude 2.9; their period is 85 years.</p>\r\n<p>Centaurus also has many dimmer double stars and binary stars. 3 Centauri is a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 4.6 and a secondary of magnitude 6.1. The primary is 298 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Centaurus is home to many variable stars. R Centauri is a Mira variable star with a minimum magnitude of 11.8 and a maximum magnitude of 5.3; it is 2100 light-years from Earth and has a period of 18 months. V810 Centauri is a semiregular variable.</p>\r\n<p>BPM 37093 is a white dwarf star whose carbon atoms are thought to have formed a crystalline structure. Since diamond also consists of carbon arranged in a crystalline lattice (though of a different configuration), scientists have nicknamed this star "Lucy" after the Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."</p>', '1060 sq. deg.

(18, 'Ophiuchus', 'Ophiuchus /ɒfiˈjuːkəs/ is a large constellation located around the celestial equator. Its name is from the Greek Ὀφιοῦχος "serpent-bearer", and it is commonly represented as a man grasping the snake that is represented by the constellation Serpens. Ophiuchus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It was formerly referred to as Serpentarius /sɜrpənˈtɛəriəs/ and Anguitenens.\r\n<p>Ophiuchus is located between Aquila, Serpens and Hercules, northwest of the center of the Milky Way. The southern part lies between Scorpius to the west and Sagittarius to the east. In the northern hemisphere, it is best visible in summer. It is located opposite Orion in the sky. Ophiuchus is depicted as a man grasping a serpent; the interposition of his body divides the snake constellation Serpens into two parts, Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, which are nonetheless counted as one constellation.</p>\r\n<p>Ophiuchus straddles the equator but lies predominately to its south. However, Rasalhague, a fairly conspicuous star in its north, is circumpolar north of 78° north latitude. The constellation extends southward to −30° declination. Segments of the ecliptic that lie within Ophiuchus lie south of −20° declination. A determination of exactly where these stars are visible on Earth would depend on atmospheric refraction, the Novaya Zemlya effect, mountains and clouds.</p>\r\n<p>In contrast to Orion, it is in the period November–January (summer in the Southern Hemisphere, winter in the Northern Hemisphere) when Ophiuchus is in the daytime sky and thus not visible at most latitudes. However for much of the Arctic Circle in the Northern Hemisphere''s winter months, the Sun is below the horizon even at midday. Stars (and thus parts of Ophiuchus, especially Rasalhague) are then visible at twilight for a few hours around local noon, low in the South. In the Northern Hemisphere''s spring and summer months, when Ophiuchus is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation is actually not visible, at those times and places in the Arctic when midnight sun obscures the stars. In countries close to the equator Ophiuchus appears overhead in June around midnight and in the October evening sky.</p>', '948 sq. deg.

(19, 'Leo', 'Leo /ˈliːoʊ/ is one of the constellations of the zodiac, lying between Cancer to the west and Virgo to the east. Its name is Latin for lion, and to the ancient Greeks represented the Nemean Lion killed by the mythical Greek hero Heracles (known to the ancient Romans as Hercules) as one of his twelve labors. Its symbol is ( ♌). One of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, Leo remains one of the 88 modern constellations today, and one of the most easily recognizable due to its many bright stars and a distinctive shape that is reminiscent of the crouching lion it depicts. The lion''s mane and shoulders also form an asterism known as "the Sickle," which to modern observers may resemble a backwards "question mark."\r\n<p>Leo contains many bright stars, many of which were individually identified by the ancients. There are four stars of first or second magnitude, which render this constellation especially prominent:</p>\r\n    <p>Regulus, designated Alpha Leonis, is a blue-white main-sequence star of magnitude 1.34, 77.5 light-years from Earth. It is a double star divisible in binoculars, with a secondary of magnitude 7.7. Its traditional name (Regulus) means "the little king".</p>\r\n    <p>Beta Leonis, called Denebola, is at the opposite end of the constellation to Regulus. It is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.23, 36 light-years from Earth. The name Denebola means "the lion''s tail".</p>\r\n    <p>Algieba, Gamma Leonis, is a binary star with a third optical component; the primary and secondary are divisible in small telescopes and the tertiary is visible in binoculars. The primary is a gold-yellow giant star of magnitude 2.61 and the secondary is similar but at magnitude 3.6; they have a period of 600 years and are 126 light-years from Earth. The unrelated tertiary, 40 Leonis, is a yellow-tinged star of magnitude 4.8. Its traditional name, Algieba, means "the forehead".</p>\r\n    <p>Delta Leonis, called Zosma, is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.58, 58 light-years from Earth. Epsilon Leonis is a yellow giant of magnitude 3.0, 251 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n    <p>Zeta Leonis, called Adhafera, is an optical triple star. The brightest and only star designated Zeta Leonis, is a white giant star of magnitude 3.65, 260 light-years from Earth. The second brightest, 39 Leonis, is widely spaced to the south and of magnitude 5.8. 35 Leonis is to the north and of magnitude 6.0.</p>\r\n    <p>Iota Leonis is a binary star divisible in medium amateur telescopes; they are divisible in small amateur telescopes at their widest (2053-2063). To the unaided eye, Iota Leonis appears to be a yellow-tinged star of magnitude 4.0. The system, 79 light-years from Earth, has components of magnitude 4.1 and 6.7 with a period of 183.</p>\r\n    <p>Tau Leonis is a double star visible in binoculars. The primary is a yellow giant of magnitude 5.0, 621 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a star of magnitude 8. 54 Leonis is a binary star 289 light-years from Earth, divisible in small telescopes. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 4.5 and the secondary is a blue-white star of magnitude 6.3.</p>\r\n<p>The other named stars in Leo are Mu Leonis, Rasalas (an abbreviation of "Al Ras al Asad al Shamaliyy," meaning "The Lion''s Head Toward the South"); and Theta Leonis, Chertan or Coxa ("hip").</p>\r\n<p>Leo is also home to one bright variable star, the red giant R Leonis. It is a Mira variable with a minimum magnitude of 10 and normal maximum magnitude of 6; it periodically brightens to magnitude 4.4. R Leonis, 330 light-years from Earth, has a period of 310 days and a diameter of 450 solar diameters.</p>\r\n<p>The star Wolf 359 (CN Leonis), one of the nearest stars to Earth at 7.8 light-years away, is in Leo. Wolf 359 is a red dwarf of magnitude 13.5; it periodically brightens by one magnitude or less because it is a flare star. Gliese 436, a faint star in Leo about 33 light years away from the Sun, is orbited by a transiting Neptune-mass extrasolar planet.</p>\r\n<p>The carbon star CW Leo (IRC +10216) is the brightest star in the night sky at the infrared N-band (10 μm wavelength).</p>\r\n<p>The star SDSS J102915+172927 (Caffau''s star) is a population II star in the galactic halo seen in Leo.

(20, 'Sagittarius', 'Sagittarius is one of the constellations of the zodiac. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for the archer, and its symbol is (Unicode U+2650 ♐), a stylized arrow. Sagittarius is commonly represented as a centaur drawing a bow. It lies between Scorpius and Ophiuchus to the west and Capricornus to the east.\r\n<p>As seen from the northern hemisphere, the constellation''s brighter stars form an easily recognizable asterism known as ''the Teapot''. The stars δ Sgr (Kaus Media), ε Sgr (Kaus Australis), ζ Sgr (Ascella), and φ Sgr (Nanto) form the body of the pot; λ Sgr (Kaus Borealis) is the point of the lid; γ2 Sgr (Alnasl) is the tip of the spout; and σ Sgr (Nunki) and τ Sgr the handle.\r\nMarking the bottom of the teapot''s "handle" (or the shoulder area of the archer, are the bright star (2.59 magnitude) Zeta Sagittarii (ζ Sgr), named Ascella, and the fainter Tau Sagittarii (τ Sgr).</p>\r\n<p>To complete the teapot metaphor, under good conditions, a particularly dense area of the Milky Way can be seen rising in a north-westerly arc above the spout, like a puff of steam rising from a boiling kettle.</p>\r\n<p>The constellation as a whole is often depicted as having the rough appearance of a stick-figure archer drawing its bow, with the fainter stars providing the outline of the horse''s body. Sagittarius famously points its arrow at the heart of Scorpius, represented by the reddish star Antares, as the two constellations race around the sky. Following the direct line formed by Delta Sagittarii (δ Sgr) and Gamma Sagittarii (γ Sgr) leads nearly directly to Antares. , Fittingly, Gamma Sagittarii is Alnasl, the Arabic word for "arrowhead", and Delta Sagittarii is called Kaus Media, the "center of the bow," from which the arrow protrudes. Kaus Media bisects Lambda Sagittarii (λ Sgr) and Epsilon Sagittarii (ε Sgr), whose names Kaus Borealis and Kaus Australis refer to the northern and southern portions of the bow, respectively.\r\nα Sgr (Rukbat, meaning "the archer''s knee") despite having the "alpha" appellation, is not the brightest star of the constellation, having a magnitude of only 3.96 (not shown on the main map as it is located below the map''s southeastern corner, north is up). Instead, the brightest star is Epsilon Sagittarii (ε Sgr) ("Kaus Australis," or "southern part of the bow"), at magnitude 1.85.</p>\r\n<p>Sigma Sagittarii (σ Sgr) ("Nunki") is the constellation''s second-brightest star at magnitude 2.08. Nunki is a B2V star approximately 260 light years away. \r\n"Nunki" is a Babylonian name of uncertain origin, but thought to represent the sacred Babylonian city of Eridu on the Euphrates, which would make Nunki the oldest star name currently in use.</p>\r\n<p>Zeta Sagittarii (ζ Sgr) ("Ascella"), with apparent magnitude 2.61 of A2 spectra, is actually a double star whose two components have magnitudes 3.3 and 3.5.</p>\r\n<p>Delta Sagittarii (δ Sgr) ("Kaus Maridionalis"), is a K2 spectra star with magnitude 2.71 and only 85 light years from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Eta Sagittarii (η Sgr) is a double star with component magnitudes of 3.18 and 10, while Pi Sagittarii (π Sgr) is actually a triple system whose components have magnitudes 3.7, 3.8, and 6.0.</p>\r\n<p>The Bayer designation Beta Sagittarii (Beta Sgr, β Sagittarii, β Sgr) is shared by two star systems, β¹ Sagittarii, with apparent magnitude 3.96, and β² Sagittarii, magnitude 7.4. The two stars are separated by 0.36° in the sky and are 378 light years from earth. Beta Sagittarii, located at a position associated with the forelegs of the centaur, has the traditional name Arkab, meaning "achilles tendon."</p>\r\n<p>Nova Sagittarii 2015 No. 2 was discovered on March 15, 2015, by John Seach of Chatsworth Island, NSW, Australia. It lies near the center of the constellation. It reached a peak magnitude of 4.3 before steadily fading.</p>', '867 sq. deg.

(22, 'Andromeda', 'Andromeda is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century Greco-Roman astronomer Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Located north of the celestial equator, it is named for Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia, in the Greek myth, who was chained to a rock to be eaten by the sea monster Cetus. Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon. It is one of the largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees. This is over 1,400 times the size of the full moon, 55% of the size of the largest constellation, Hydra, and over 10 times the size of the smallest constellation, Crux.\r\n<p>Its brightest star, Alpha Andromedae, is a binary star that has also been counted as a part of Pegasus, while Gamma Andromedae is a colorful binary and a popular target for amateur astronomers. Only marginally dimmer than Alpha, Beta Andromedae is a red giant, its color visible to the naked eye. The constellation''s most obvious deep-sky object is the naked-eye Andromeda Galaxy (M31, also called the Great Galaxy of Andromeda), the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and one of the brightest Messier objects. Several fainter galaxies, including M31''s companions M110 and M32, as well as the more distant NGC 891, lie within Andromeda. The Blue Snowball Nebula, a planetary nebula, is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object.</p>\r\n<p>In Chinese astronomy, the stars that make up Andromeda were members of four different constellations that had astrological and mythological significance; a constellation related to Andromeda also exists in Hindu mythology. Andromeda is the location of the radiant for the Andromedids, a weak meteor shower that occurs in November.</p>\r\n<p>The uranography of Andromeda has its roots most firmly in the Greek tradition, though a female figure in Andromeda''s location had appeared earlier in Babylonian astronomy. The stars that make up Pisces and the middle portion of modern Andromeda formed a constellation representing a fertility goddess, sometimes named as Anunitum or the Lady of the Heavens.</P>\r\n<p>Andromeda is known as "the Chained Lady" or "the Chained Woman" in English. It was known as Mulier Catenata ("chained woman") in Latin and al-Mar''at al Musalsalah in Arabic. It has also been called Persea ("Perseus''s wife") or Cepheis ("Cepheus''s daughter"), all names that refer to Andromeda''s role in the Greco-Roman myth of Perseus, in which Cassiopeia, the queen of Ethiopia, bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the Nereids, sea nymphs blessed with incredible beauty. Offended at her remark, the nymphs petitioned Poseidon to punish Cassiopeia for her insolence, which he did by commanding the sea monster Cetus to attack Ethiopia. Andromeda''s panicked father, Cepheus, was told by the Oracle of Ammon that the only way to save his kingdom was to sacrifice his daughter to Cetus. She was chained to a rock by the sea but was saved by the hero Perseus, who used the head of Medusa to turn the monster into stone; Algol (β Persei), the "Demon Star", marks the head of Medusa. Perseus and Andromeda then married; the myth recounts that the couple had nine children together – seven sons and two daughter – and founded Mycenae and its Persideae dynasty. After Andromeda''s death Athena placed her in the sky as a constellation, to honor her. Several of the neighboring constellations (Perseus, Cassiopeia, Cetus, and Cepheus) also represent characters in the Perseus myth. It is connected with the constellation Pegasus.</p>\r\n<p>Andromeda was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by Ptolemy in his 2nd-century Almagest, in which it was defined as a specific pattern of stars. She is typically depicted with α Andromedae as her head, ο and λ Andromedae as her chains, and δ, π, μ, Β, and γ Andromedae representing her body and legs. However, there is no universal depiction of Andromeda and the stars used to represent her body, head, and chains. Arab astronomers were aware of Ptolemy''s constellations, but they included a second constellation representing a fish at Andromeda''s feet. Several stars from Andromeda and most of the stars in Lacerta were combined in 1787 by German astronomer Johann Bode to form Frederici Honores (also called Friedrichs Ehre). It was designed to honor King Frederick II of Prussia, but quickly fell into disuse. Since the time of Ptolemy, Andromeda has remained a constellation and is officially recognized by the International Astronomical Union, although like all modern constellations, it is now defined as a specific region of the sky that includes both Ptolemy''s pattern and the surrounding stars. In 1922, the IAU defined its recommended three-letter abbreviation, "And". The official boundaries of Andromeda were defined in 1930 by Eugène Delporte as a polygon of 36 segments. Its right ascension is between 22h 57.5m and 2h 39.3m and its declination is between 53.19° and 21.68° in the equatorial coordinate system.</p>', '722 sq. deg.

(23, 'Virgo', 'Virgo is one of the constellations of the zodiac. Its name is Latin for virgin, and its symbol is ♍. Lying between Leo to the west and Libra to the east, it is the second largest constellation in the sky (after Hydra). It can be easily found through its brightest star, Spica.\r\n<p>The bright Spica makes it easy to locate Virgo, as it can be found by following the curve of the Big Dipper/Plough to Arcturus in Boötes and continuing from there in the same curve ("follow the arc to Arcturus and speed on to Spica").</p>\r\n<p>Due to the effects of precession, the First Point of Libra, (also known as the autumn equinox point) lies within the boundaries of Virgo very close to β Virginis. This is one of the two points in the sky where the celestial equator crosses the ecliptic (the other being the First Point of Aries, now in the constellation of Pisces.) This point will pass into the neighbouring constellation of Leo around the year 2440.</p>\r\n<p>Besides Spica, other bright stars in Virgo include β Virginis (Zavijava), γ Vir (Porrima), δ Virginis (Auva) and ε Virginis (Vindemiatrix). Other fainter stars that were also given names are ζ Virginis (Heze), η Virginis (Zaniah), ι Virginis (Syrma) and μ Virginis (Rijl al Awwa).</p>\r\n<p>The star 70 Virginis has one of the first known extrasolar planetary systems with one confirmed planet 7.5 times the mass of Jupiter.</p>\r\n<p>The star Chi Virginis has one of the most massive planets ever detected, at a mass of 11.1 times that of Jupiter.</p>\r\n<p>The sun-like star 61 Virginis has three planets: one is a super-Earth and two are Neptune-mass planets.</p>\r\n<p>SS Virginis is a variable star with a noticeable red color. It varies in magnitude from a minimum of 9.6 to a maximum of 6.0 over a period of approximately one year.</p>\r\n<p>There are 35 verified exoplanets orbiting 29 stars in Virgo, including PSR B1257+12 (three planets), 70 Virginis (one planet), Chi Virginis (one planet), 61 Virginis (three planets), NY Virginis (two planets), and 59 Virginis (one planet).</p>\r\n<p>Because of the presence of a galaxy cluster (consequently called the Virgo cluster) within its borders 5° to 12° west of ε Vir (Vindemiatrix), this constellation is especially rich in galaxies.</p>\r\n<p>Some examples are Messier 49 (elliptical), Messier 58 (spiral), Messier 59 (elliptical), Messier 60 (elliptical), Messier 61 (spiral), Messier 84 (lenticular), Messier 86 (lenticular), Messier 87 (elliptical and a famous radio source), Messier 89 (elliptical) and Messier 90 (spiral). A noted galaxy that is not part of the cluster is the Sombrero Galaxy (M104), an unusual spiral galaxy. It is located about 10° due west of Spica.</p>\r\n<p>NGC 4639 is a face-on barred spiral galaxy located 78 Mly from Earth (redshift 0.0034). Its outer arms have a high number of Cepheid variables, which are used as standard candles to determine astronomical distances. Because of this, astronomers used several Cepheid variables in NGC 4639 to calibrate type 1a supernovae as standard candles for more distant galaxies.</p>\r\n<p>Virgo possesses several galaxy clusters, one of which is HCG 62. A Hickson Compact Group, HCG 62 is at a distance of 200 Mly from Earth (redshift 0.0137) and possesses a large central elliptical galaxy. It has a heterogeneous halo of extremely hot gas, posited to be due to the active galactic nucleus at the core of the central elliptical galaxy.</p>\r\n<p>M87 is the largest galaxy in the Virgo cluster, and is at a distance of 60 Mly from Earth (redshift 0.0035). It is a major radio source, partially due to its jet of electrons being flung out of the galaxy by its central supermassive black hole. Because this jet is visible in several different wavelengths, it is of interest to astronomers who wish to observe black holes in a unique galaxy.\r\nM84 is another elliptical radio galaxy in the constellation of Virgo; it is at a distance of 60 Mly (redshift 0.0035) as well. Astronomers have surmised that the speed of the gas clouds orbiting the core (approximately 400 km/s) indicates the presence of an object with a mass 300 million times that of the sun, which is most likely a black hole.</p>\r\n<p>The Sombrero Galaxy, M104, is an edge-on spiral galaxy located 28 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0034). It has a bulge at its center made up of older stars that is larger than normal. It is surrounded by large, bright globular clusters and has a very prominent dust lane made up of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.</p>\r\n<p>NGC 4438 is a peculiar galaxy with an active galactic nucleus, at a distance of 50 Mly from Earth (redshift 0.0035). Its supermassive black hole is ejecting jets of matter, creating bubbles with a diameter of up to 78 ly.</p>\r\n<p>NGC 4261 also has a black hole 20 ly from its center with a mass of 1.2 billion solar masses. It is located at a distance of 45 Mly from Earth (redshift 0.0075), and has an unusually dusty disk with a diameter of 300 ly. Along with M84 and M87, NGC 4261 has strong emissions in the radio spectrum.\r\nIC 1101 is a supergiant elliptical galaxy in the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster located about 1.07 Gly from Earth. At the diameter of 5.5 million light years, or more than 50 times the size of the Milky Way, it was the largest known galaxy in the universe.</p>\r\n<p>Virgo is also home to the quasar 3C 273 which was the first quasar ever to be identified. With a magnitude of ~12.9 it is also the optically brightest quasar in the sky.</p>', '1294 sq. deg.

Hercules was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. It is the fifth largest of the modern constellations.\r\n<p>Hercules has no first or second magnitude stars. However, it does have several stars above magnitude 4. Alpha Herculis, traditionally called Rasalgethi, is a binary star resolvable in small amateur telescopes, 400 light-years from Earth. The primary is an irregular variable star; it is a red giant with a minimum magnitude of 4 and a maximum magnitude of 3. It has a diameter of 400 solar diameters. The secondary, which orbits every 3600 years, is a blue-green hued star of magnitude 5.4. Its common name means "the kneeler''s head". Beta Herculis, also called Kornephoros, is the brightest star in Hercules. It is a yellow giant of magnitude 2.8, 148 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means "club-bearer". deltoide 5512 is a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 3.1,and is 78 light-years from Earth. The optical companion is of magnitude 8.2. Gamma Herculis is also a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a white giant of magnitude 3.8, 195 light-years from Earth. The optical companion, widely separated, is 10th magnitude. Zeta Herculis is a binary star that is becoming divisible in medium-aperture amateur telescopes, as the components widen to their peak in 2025. The system, 35 light-years from Earth, has a period of 34.5 years. The primary is a yellow-tinged star of magnitude 2.9 and the secondary is an orange star of magnitude 5.7.</p>\r\n<p>There are several dimmer variable stars in Hercules. 30 Herculis, also called g Herculis, is a semiregular red giant with a period of 3 months. 361 light-years from Earth, it has a minimum magnitude of 6.3 and a maximum magnitude of 4.3. 68 Herculis, also called u Herculis, is a Beta Lyrae-type eclipsing binary star. 865 light-years from Earth, it has a period of 2 days; its minimum magnitude is 5.4 and its maximum magnitude is 4.7.</p>\r\n<p>Hercules is also home to many double stars and binary stars. Kappa Herculis is a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a yellow giant of magnitude 5.0, 388 light-years from Earth; the secondary is an orange giant of magnitude 6.3, 470 light-years from Earth. Rho Herculis is a binary star 402 light-years from Earth, divisible in small amateur telescopes. Both components are blue-green giant stars; the primary is magnitude 4.5 and the secondary is magnitude 5.5. 95 Herculis is a binary star divisible in small telescopes, 470 light-years from Earth. The primary is a silvery giant star of magnitude 4.9 and the secondary is an old giant star of magnitude 5.2. 100 Herculis is a double star easily divisible in small amateur telescopes.

(25, 'Ursa Major', 'Ursa Major /ˈɜrsə ˈmeɪdʒər/ (also known as the Great Bear and Charles'' Wain) is a constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. One of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy (second century AD), it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It can be visible throughout the year in most of the northern hemisphere. Its name, Latin for "the greater (or larger) she-bear", stands as a reference to and in direct contrast with Ursa Minor, "the smaller she-bear", with which it is frequently associated in mythology and amateur astronomy. The constellation''s most recognizable asterism, a group of seven relatively bright stars commonly known as the "Big Dipper", "the Wagon" or "the Plough" (among others), both mimicks the shape of the lesser bear (the "Little Dipper") and is commonly used as a navigational pointer towards the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor. The Big Dipper and the constellation as a whole have mythological significance in numerous world cultures, usually as a symbol of the north.\r\n<p>The third largest constellation in the sky, Ursa Major is home to many deep-sky objects including seven Messier objects, four other NGC objects and I Zwicky 18, the youngest known galaxy in the visible universe.</p>\r\n<p>Ursa Major occupies a large area in the northern celestial hemisphere. The third largest constellation in the night sky (after Hydra and Virgo), its 1279.66 square degrees of surface area being equivalent to 3.10% of the total sky. The official constellation boundaries, set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, form a 28-sided irregular polygon which, according to the equatorial coordinate system, stretches between the right ascension coordinates of 08<sup>h</sup> 08.3<sup>m</sup> and 14<sup>h</sup> 29.0<sup>m</sup> and the declination coordinates of 28.30° and 73.14°. It is bordered by eight other constellations: Draco to the north and northeast, Boötes to the east, Canes Venatici to the east and southeast, Coma Berenices to the southeast, Leo and Leo Minor to the south, Lynx to the southwest and Camelopardalis to the northwest. It''s also the namesake of its constellation family, which includes all the constellations it borders except for Leo (a member of the Zodiac), and also Ursa Minor and Corona Borealis. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is ''UMa''.</p>\r\n<p>The "Big Dipper" (a term mainly used in the United States and Canada; Plough and Charles'' Wain are used in the United Kingdom, Großer Wagen in Germany and Saptarshi in India) asterism within Ursa Major is made up of seven bright stars (six of them of the second magnitude or higher) that together comprise one of the best-known patterns in the sky. Like many of its common names allude to, its shape is said to resemble either a ladle, an agricultural plough or wagon; in the context of Ursa Major, they are commonly drawn to represent the hindquarters and tail of the Great Bear. Starting with the "ladle" portion of the dipper and extending clockwise (eastward in the sky) through the handle, these stars are the following:<p>\r\n    <p>α Ursae Majoris, known by the Arabic name Dubhe ("the bear"), which at a magnitude of 1.79 is the 35th brightest star in the sky and the second brightest of Ursa Major.</p>\r\n    <p>β Ursae Majoris, called Merak ("the loins of the bear"), with a magnitude of 2.37.</p>\r\n    <p>γ Ursae Majoris, known as either Phecda or Phad ("thigh"), with a magnitude of 2.44.</p>\r\n    <p>δ Ursae Majoris, or Megrez, meaning "root of the tail," an appropriate name given its location as the intersection of the body and tail of the bear (or the ladle and handle of the dipper).</p>\r\n    <p>ε Ursae Majoris, known as Alioth, a name which refers not to a bear but to a "black horse," the name corrupted from the original and mis-assigned to the similarly named Alcor, the naked-eye binary companion of Mizar. Alioth is the brightest star of Ursa Major and the 33rd brightest in the sky, with a magnitude of 1.76. It is also the brightest of the "peculiar A (Ap) stars," magnetic stars whose chemical elements are either depleted or enhanced, and appear to change as the star rotates.</p>\r\n    <p>ζ Ursae Majoris, Mizar, the second star in from the end of the handle of the Big Dipper, and the constellation''s fourth brightest star. Mizar, which means "girdle," forms a famous double star, with its optical companion Alcor (80 Ursae Majoris), the two of which were termed the "horse and rider" by the Arabs. The ability to resolve the two stars with the naked eye is often quoted as a test of eyesight, although even people with quite poor eyesight can see the two stars.</p>\r\n    <p>η Ursae Majoris, known as either Alkaid or Benetnash, both meaning the "end of the tail." With a magnitude of 1.85, Alkaid is the third-brightest star of Ursa Major.</p>\r\n<p>Except for Dubhe and Alkaid, the stars of the Big Dipper all have proper motions heading toward a common point in Sagittarius. A few other such stars have been identified, and together they are called the Ursa Major Moving Group.\r\nThe stars Merak (β Ursae Majoris) and Dubhe (α Ursae Majoris) are known as the "pointer stars" because they are helpful for finding Polaris, also known as the North Star or Pole Star. By visually tracing a line from Merak through Dubhe and continuing, one''s eye will land on Polaris, accurately indicating true north.</p>', '1280 sq. deg.

(26, 'Pegasus', 'Pegasus is a constellation in the northern sky, named after the winged horse Pegasus in Greek mythology. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations.\r\nWith an apparent magnitude varying between 2.37 and 2.45, the brightest star in Pegasus is the orange supergiant Epsilon Pegasi, also known as Enif, which marks the horse''s muzzle. Alpha (Markab), Beta (Scheat), and Gamma (Algenib), together with Alpha Andromedae (Alpheratz or Sirrah) form the large asterism known as the Square of Pegasus. Twelve star systems have been found to have exoplanets.\r\n<p>The Babylonian constellation IKU (field) had four stars of which three were later part of the Greek constellation Hippos (Pegasus). Pegasus, in Greek mythology, was a winged horse with magical powers. One myth regarding his powers says that his hooves dug out a spring, Hippocrene, which blessed those who drank its water with the ability to write poetry. Pegasus was the one who delivered Medusa''s head to Polydectes, after which he travelled to Mount Olympus in order to be the bearer of thunder and lightning for Zeus. Eventually, he became the horse to Bellerophon, who was asked to kill the Chimera and succeeded with the help of Athena and Pegasus. Despite this success, after the death of his children, Bellerophon asked Pegasus to take him to Mount Olympus. Though Pegasus agreed, he plummeted back to Earth after Zeus either threw a thunderbolt at him or made Pegasus buck him off. In ancient Persia, Pegasus was depicted by al-Sufi as a complete horse facing east, unlike most other uranographers, who had depicted Pegasus as half of a horse, rising out of the ocean. In al-Sufi''s depiction, Pegasus''s head is made up of the stars of Lacerta the lizard. Its right foreleg is represented by β Peg and its left foreleg is represented by η Peg, μ Peg, and λ Peg; its hind legs are marked by 9 Peg. The back is represented by π Peg and μ Cyg, and the belly is represented by ι Peg and κ Peg.</p>\r\n<p>In Chinese astronomy, the modern constellation of Pegasus lies in The Black Tortoise of the north (北方玄武), where the stars were classified in several separate asterisms of stars. Epsilon and Theta Pegasi are joined with Alpha Aquarii to form Wei 危 "rooftop", with Theta forming the roof apex.</p>\r\n<p>In Hindu astronomy, the Great Square of Pegasus contained the 26th and 27th lunar mansions. More specifically, it represented a bedstead that was a resting place for the Moon.</p>\r\n<p>Warrau and Arawak peoples in Guyana used the stars in the Great Square to represent a grill on stilts.</p>\r\n<p>Covering 1121 square degrees, Pegasus ranks 7th of the 88 constellations in size. Pegasus is bordered by Andromeda to the north and east, Lacerta to the north, Cygnus to the northwest, Vulpecula, Delphinus and Equuleus to the west, Aquarius to the south and Pisces to the south and east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the IAU in 1922, is ''Peg''. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined as a polygon of 35 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 21<sup>h</sup> 12.6<sup>m</sup> and 00<sup>h</sup> 14.6<sup>m</sup>, while the declination coordinates are between 2.33° and 36.61°. Its position in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers north of 53°S.</p>\r\n<p>Pegasus is dominated by an asterism in the shape of a rough square, although one of the stars, Delta Pegasi or Sirrah, is now officially considered to be part of Andromeda, (α Andromedae) and is more usually called "Alpheratz". Traditionally, the body of the horse consists of a quadrilateral formed by the stars α Peg, β Peg, γ Peg, and α And. The front legs of the winged horse are formed by two crooked lines of stars, one leading from η Peg to κ Peg and the other from μ Peg to 1 Pegasi. Another crooked line of stars from α Peg via θ Peg to ε Peg forms the neck and head; ε is the snout.</p>', '1121 sq. deg.

(27, 'Puppis', 'Puppis /ˈpʌpɨs/ is a constellation in the southern sky. Puppis, the Poop Deck, was originally part of an over-large constellation, the ship of "Jason and the Argonauts", Argo Navis, which centuries after its initial description, was divided into three parts, the other two being Carina (the keel and hull), and Vela (the sails of the ship). Puppis is the largest of the three constellations in square degrees. It is one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union.\r\n<p>Argo Navis was sub-divided in 1752 by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, forming Puppis. Despite the division, Lacaille kept Argo''s Bayer designations. Therefore Carina has the α, β and ε, Vela has γ and δ, Puppis has ζ, and so on.</p>\r\n<p>Several extrasolar planet systems have been found around stars in the constellation Puppis, including:</p>\r\n    <p>On July 1, 2003, a planet was found orbiting the star HD 70642. This planetary system is much like Jupiter with a wide, circular orbit and a long-period.</p>\r\n    <p>On May 17, 2006, HD 69830 (the nearest star of this constellation) was discovered to have three Neptune-mass planets, the first multi-planetary system without any Jupiter-like or Saturn-like planets. The star also hosts an asteroid belt at the region between middle planet to outer planet.</p>\r\n    <p>On June 21, 2007, the first extrasolar planet found in the open cluster NGC 2423, was discovered around the red giant star NGC 2423-3. The planet is at least 10.6 times the mass of Jupiter and orbits at 2.1 AU distance.</p>\r\n    <p>On September 22, 2008, two Jupiter-like planets were discovered around HD 60532. HD 60532 b has a minimum mass of 1.03 MJ and orbits at 0.759 AU and takes 201.3 days to complete the orbit. HD 60532 c has a minimum mass of 2.46 MJ and orbits at 1.58 AU and takes 604 days to complete the orbit.</p>\r\n<p>As the Milky Way runs through Puppis, there are a large number of open clusters in the constellation. M46 and M47 are two open clusters in the same binocular field. M47 can be seen with the naked eye under dark skies, and its brightest stars are 6th magnitude. Messier 93 (M93) is another open cluster somewhat to the south. NGC 2451 is a very bright open cluster containing the star c Puppis and the near NGC 2477 is a good target for small telescopes. The star Pi Puppis is the main component of a bright group of stars known as Collinder 135.</p>\r\n<p>M46 is a circular open cluster with an overall magnitude of 6.1 at a distance of approximately 5400 light-years from Earth. The planetary nebula NGC 2438 is superimposed; it is approximately 2900 light-years from Earth. M46 is classified as a Shapley class f and a Trumpler class III 2 m cluster. This means that it is a rich cluster that appears distinct from the star field; however, it is not at its center. The cluster''s stars, numbering between 50 and 100, have a moderate range in brightness.</p>', '673 sq. deg.

(28, 'Aquila', 'Aquila is a constellation in the northern sky. Its name is Latin for ''eagle'' and it represents the bird who carried Zeus/Jupiter''s thunderbolts in Greco-Roman mythology.\r\n<p>Aquila lies astride the celestial equator. The alpha star, Altair, is a vertex of the Summer Triangle asterism. The constellation is best seen in the summer as it is located along the Milky Way. Because of this location along the line of our galaxy, many clusters and nebulae are found within its borders, but they are dim and there are few galaxies.</p>\r\n<p>Aquila was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. It had been earlier mentioned by Eudoxus in the 4th century BC and Aratus in the 3rd century BC.</p>\r\n<p>It is now one of the 88 constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. The constellation was also known as Vultur volans (the flying vulture) to the Romans, not to be confused with Vultur cadens which was their name for Lyra. It is often held to represent the eagle who held Zeus''s/Jupiter''s thunderbolts in Greco-Roman mythology. Aquila is also associated with the eagle who kidnapped Ganymede, a son of one of the kings of Troy (associated with Aquarius), to Mount Olympus to serve as cup-bearer to the gods.</p>\r\n<p>Ptolemy catalogued nineteen stars jointly in this constellation and in the now obsolete constellation of Antinous, which was named in the reign of the emperor Hadrian (AD 117–138), but sometimes erroneously attributed to Tycho Brahe, who catalogued twelve stars in Aquila and seven in Antinous. Hevelius determined twenty-three stars in the first and nineteen in the second.\r\nThe Greek Aquila is probably based on the Babylonian constellation of the Eagle (MUL.A.MUSHEN), which is located in the same area as the Greek constellation.\r\nAquila, which lies in the Milky Way, contains many rich starfields and has been the location of many novae.</p>\r\n    <p>α Aql (Altair) is the brightest star in this constellation and one of the closest naked-eye stars to Earth at a distance of 17 light-years. Its name comes from the Arabic phrase "al-nasr al-tair", meaning "the flying eagle". Altair has a magnitude of 0.76.</p>\r\n    <P>β Aql (Alshain) is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 3.7, 45 light-years from Earth. Its name comes from the Arabic phrase "shahin-i tarazu", meaning "the balance"; this name referred to Altair, Alshain, and Tarazed.</p>\r\n    <p>γ Aql (Tarazed) is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 2.7, 460 light-years from Earth. Its name, like that of Alshain, comes from the Arabic for "the balance", "shahin-i tarazu".</p>\r\n    <p>ζ Aql is a blue-white-hued star of magnitude 3.0, 83 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n    <p>η Aql is a yellow-white-hued supergiant star, 1200 light-years from Earth. Among the brightest Cepheid variable stars, it has a minimum magnitude of 4.4 and a maximum magnitude of 3.5 with a period of 7.2 days.</p>\r\n    <p>15 Aql is an optical double star. The primary is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 5.4, 325 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a purple-hued star of magnitude 7.0, 550 light-years from Earth. The pair is easily resolved in small amateur telescopes.</p>\r\n    <p>57 Aql is a binary star. The primary is a blue-hued star of magnitude 5.7 and the secondary is a white star of magnitude 6.5. The system is approximately 350 light-years from Earth; the pair is easily resolved in small amateur telescopes.</p>\r\n    <p>R Aql is a red-hued giant star 690 light-years from Earth. It is a Mira variable with a minimum magnitude of 12.0, a maximum magnitude of 6.0, and a period of approximately 9 months. It has a diameter of 400 D<sub>☉</sub>.</P>\r\n    <p>FF Aql is a yellow-white-hued supergiant star, 2500 light-years from Earth. It is a Cepheid variable star with a minimum magnitude of 5.7, a maximum magnitude of 5.2, and a period of 4.5 days.</p>\r\n    <p>ρ Aql moved across the border into neighboring Delphinus in 1992.\r\nTwo major novae have been observed in Aquila: the first one was in 389 BC and was recorded as being as bright as Venus; the other (Nova Aquilae 1918) briefly shone brighter than Altair, the brightest star in Aquila.</p>\r\n\r\n', '652 sq. deg.

(29, 'Serpens', 'Serpens ("the Serpent", Greek Ὄφις) is a constellation of the northern hemisphere. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. It is unique among the modern constellations in being split into two non-contiguous parts, Serpens Caput (Serpent''s Head) to the west and Serpens Cauda (Serpent''s Tail) to the east. Between these two halves lies the constellation of Ophiuchus, the "Serpent-Bearer". In figurative representations, the body of the serpent is represented as passing behind Ophiuchus between Mu Serpentis in Serpens Caput and Nu Serpentis in Serpens Cauda.\r\n<p>The brightest star in Serpens is the red giant star Alpha Serpentis, or Unukalhai, in Serpens Caput, with an apparent magnitude of 2.63. Also located in Serpens Caput are the naked-eye globular cluster Messier 5 and the naked-eye variables R Serpentis and Tau4 Serpentis. Notable extragalactic objects include Seyfert''s Sextet, one of the densest galaxy clusters known; Arp 220, the prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy; and Hoag''s Object, the most famous of the very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies.</p>\r\n<p>Part of the Milky Way''s galactic plane passes through Serpens Cauda, which is therefore rich in galactic deep-sky objects, such as the Eagle Nebula (IC 4703) and its associated star cluster Messier 16. The nebula measures 70 light-years by 50 light-years and contains the Pillars of Creation, three dust clouds that became famous for the image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Other striking objects include the Red Square Nebula, one of the few objects in astronomy to take on a square shape; and Westerhout 40, a massive nearby star-forming region consisting of a molecular cloud and an H II region.\r\nIn Greek mythology, Serpens represents a snake held by the healer Asclepius. Represented in the sky by the constellation Ophiuchus, Asclepius once killed a snake, but the animal was subsequently resurrected after a second snake placed a revival herb on it before its death. As snakes shed their skin every year, they were known as the symbol of rebirth in ancient Greek society, and legend says Asclepius would revive dead humans using the same technique he witnessed. Although this is likely the logic for Serpens'' presence with Ophiuchus, the true reason is still not fully known. Sometimes, Serpens was depicted as coiling around Ophiuchus, but the majority of atlases showed Serpens passing either behind Ophiuchus'' body or between his legs.</p>\r\n<p>In some ancient atlases, the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus were depicted as two separate constellations, although more often they were shown as a single constellation. One notable figure to depict Serpens separately was Johann Bayer; thus, Serpens'' stars are cataloged with separate Bayer designations from those of Ophiuchus. When Eugène Delporte established modern constellation boundaries in the 1920s, he elected to depict the two separately. However, this posed the problem of how to disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas—the head and the tail—separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, caput being the Latin word for head and cauda the Latin word for tail.</p>\r\n<p>In Chinese astronomy, most of the stars of Serpens represented part of a wall surrounding a marketplace, known as Tianshi, which was in Ophiuchus and part of Hercules. Serpens also contains a few Chinese constellations. Two stars in the tail represented part of Shilou, the tower with the market office. Another star in the tail represented Liesi, jewel shops. One star in the head (Mu Serpentis) marked Tianru, the crown prince''s wet nurse, or sometimes rain.\r\nThere were two "serpent" constellations in Babylonian astronomy, known as Mušḫuššu and Bašmu. It appears that Mušḫuššu was depicted as a hybrid of a dragon, a lion and a bird, and loosely corresponded to Hydra. Bašmu was a horned serpent (c.f. Ningishzida) and roughly corresponds to the Ὄφις constellation of Eudoxus of Cnidus on which the Ὄφις (Serpens) of Ptolemy is based.</p>\r\n<p>Serpens is the only one of the 88 modern constellations to be split into two disconnected regions in the sky: Serpens Caput (the head) and Serpens Cauda (the tail). The constellation is also unusual in that it depends on another constellation for context; specifically, it is being held by the Serpent Bearer Ophiuchus.</p>\r\n<p>Serpens Caput is bordered by Libra to the south, Virgo and Boötes to the east, Corona Borealis to the north, and Ophiuchus and Hercules to the west; Serpens Cauda is bordered by Sagittarius to the south, Scutum and Aquila to the east, and Ophiuchus to the north and west. Covering 636.9 square degrees total, it ranks 23rd of the 88 constellations in size. It appears prominently in both the northern and southern skies during the Northern Hemisphere''s summer. Its main asterism consists of 11 stars, and 108 stars in total are brighter than magnitude 6.5, the traditional limit for naked-eye visibility.</p>\r\n<p>Serpens Caput''s boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a 15-sided polygon, while Serpens Cauda''s are defined by a 25-sided polygon. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of Serpens Caput''s borders lie between 15<sup>h</sup> 10.4<sup>m</sup> and 16<sup>h</sup> 22.5<sup>m</sup>, while the declination coordinates are between 25.66° and −03.72°.

(30, 'Perseus', 'Perseus, named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus, is a constellation in the northern sky. It was one of 48 listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and among the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is located in the northern celestial hemisphere near several other constellations named after ancient Greek legends surrounding Perseus, including Andromeda to the west and Cassiopeia to the north. Perseus is also bordered by Aries and Taurus to the south, Auriga to the east, Camelopardalis to the north, and Triangulum to the west. Some star atlases during the early 19th Century also depicted Perseus holding onto the head of the Medusa, whose asterism was named together as Perseus et Caput Medusae, however, this never became into popular usage.\r\n<p>The galactic plane of the Milky Way passes through Perseus but is mostly obscured by molecular clouds. The constellation''s brightest star is the yellow-white supergiant Alpha Persei (also called Mirfak), which shines at magnitude 1.79. It and many of the surrounding stars are members of an open cluster known as the Alpha Persei Cluster. The best-known star, however, is Algol (Beta Persei), linked with ominous legends because of its variability, which is noticeable to the naked eye. Rather than being an intrinsically variable star, it is an eclipsing binary. Other notable star systems in Perseus include X Persei, a binary system containing a neutron star, and GK Persei, a nova that peaked at magnitude 0.2 in 1901. The Double Cluster, comprising two open clusters quite near each other in the sky, was known to the ancient Chinese. The constellation gives its name to the Perseus Cluster (Abell 426), a massive galaxy cluster located 250 million light-years from Earth. It hosts the radiant of the annual Perseids meteor shower—one of the most prominent meteor showers in the sky.</p>\r\n<p>The constellation of Perseus may be derived from the Babylonian Old Man (MUL.SHU.GI) constellation, then associated with East in the MUL.APIN—an astronomical compilation dating to around 1000 BCE. In Greek mythology, Perseus was the son of Danaë, who was sent by King Polydectes to bring the head of Medusa the Gorgon—whose visage caused all who gazed upon her to turn to stone—as a wedding gift. Perseus slew Medusa in her sleep, and Pegasus and Chrysaor appeared from her body. Perseus continued to the realm of Cepheus whose daughter Andromeda was to be sacrificed to Cetus the sea monster.\r\nPerseus rescued the princess Andromeda from Cetus by turning it to stone with Medusa''s head. He turned Polydectes and his followers to stone and appointed Dictys the fisherman king. Perseus and Andromeda married and had six children. In the sky, Perseus lies near the constellations Andromeda, Cepheus, Cassiopeia (Andromeda''s mother), Cetus, and Pegasus.</p>\r\n<p>Four Chinese constellations are contained in the area of the sky identified with Perseus in the West. Tiānchuán (天船), the Celestial Boat, was the third paranatellon (A star or constellation which rises at the same time as another star or object.) of the third house of the White Tiger of the West, representing the boats that Chinese people were reminded to build in case of a catastrophic flood season. Incorporating stars from the northern part of the constellation, it contained Mu, Delta, Psi, Alpha, Gamma and Eta Persei. Jīshuǐ (積水), the Swollen Waters, was the fourth paranatellon of the aforementioned house, representing the potential of unusually high floods during the end of August and beginning of September at the beginning of the flood season. Lambda and possibly Mu Persei lay within it. Dàlíng (大陵), the Great Trench, was the fifth paranatellon of that house, representing the trenches where criminals executed en masse in August were interred. It was formed by Kappa, Omega, Rho, 24, 17 and 15 Persei. The pile of corpses prior to their interment was represented by Jīshī (積屍, Algol), the sixth paranatellon of the house. The Double Cluster, h and Chi Persei, had special significance in Chinese astronomy. Known as Hsi and Ho, the two clusters represented two astronomers who failed to predict a total solar eclipse and were subsequently beheaded.\r\nIn Polynesia, Perseus was not commonly recognized as a separate constellation; the only people that named it were those of the Society Islands, who called it Faa-iti, meaning "Little Valley". Algol may have been named Matohi by the Māori people, but the evidence for this identification is disputed. Matohi ("Split") occasionally came into conflict with Tangaroa-whakapau over which of them should appear in the sky, the outcome affecting the tides. It matches the Maori description of a blue-white star near Aldebaran but does not disappear as the myth would indicate.</p>\r\n<p>Perseus is bordered by Aries and Taurus to the south, Auriga to the east, Camelopardalis and Cassiopeia to the north, and Andromeda and Triangulum to the west. Covering 615 square degrees, it ranks twenty-fourth of the 88 constellations in size. It appears prominently in the northern sky during the Northern Hemisphere''s spring. Its main asterism consists of 19 stars. The constellation''s boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a 26-sided polygon. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 01<sup>h</sup> 29.1<sup>m</sup> and 04<sup>h</sup> 51.2<sup>m</sup>, while the declination coordinates are between 30.92° and 59.11°.

(31, 'Cassiopeia', 'Cassiopeia is a constellation in the northern sky, named after the vain queen Cassiopeia in Greek mythology, who boasted about her unrivalled beauty. Cassiopeia was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century Greek astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. It is easily recognizable due to its distinctive ''M'' shape when in upper culmination but in higher northern locations when near lower culminations in spring and summer it has a ''W'' shape, formed by five bright stars. It is bordered by Andromeda to the south, Perseus to the southeast, and Cepheus to the north. It is opposite the Big Dipper. In northern locations above 34ºN latitude it is visible year-round and in the (sub)tropics it can be seen at its clearest from September to early November in its characteristic ''M'' shape. Even in low southern latitudes below 25ºS is can be seen low in the North.\r\nThe four brightest stars of Cassiopeia are all brighter than the third magnitude.\r\n    <p>Alpha Cassiopeiae, traditionally called Shedir (from the Arabic Al Sadr, "the breast"), is a double star. The primary is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 2.2, 229 light-years from Earth. The secondary is widely separated from the primary and is of magnitude 8.9. Its traditional name means "breast".</p>\r\n    <p>Beta Cassiopeiae, or Caph (meaning "hand"), is a white-hued star of magnitude 2.3, 54 light-years from Earth. 16th-century Arabian astronomer Al Tizini gave this star the name Al Sanam al Nakah, (The Camel''s Hump), referring to the contemporaneous Persian figure.</p>\r\n    <p>The two other notably bright stars in Cassiopeia are both variable stars. Gamma Cassiopeiae is a shell star, a type of variable star that has a very high rate of rotation. This causes the star to be somewhat unstable and periodically eject rings of material. Gamma Cassiopeiae has a minimum magnitude of 3.0 and a maximum magnitude of 1.6; it is currently approximately magnitude 2.2.</p>\r\n    <p>Delta Cassiopeiae, also known as "Ruchbah" or "Rukbat," meaning "knee," is an Algol-type eclipsing variable star. It varies by 0.1 magnitudes around magnitude 2.7; its period is 2 years and 1 month. Ruchbah appears to have a blue-white hue and it is 99 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>There are several dimmer single stars in Cassiopeia. Epsilon Cassiopeiae is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 3.3, 442 light-years from Earth. Rho Cassiopeiae is a semi-regular pulsating variable yellow-hued supergiant star, among the most luminous stars in the galaxy with a luminosity of approximately 500,000 solar luminosities. It has a minimum magnitude of 6.2 and a maximum magnitude of 4.1; its period is approximately 320 days. Rho Cassiopeiae is about 10,000 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Cassiopeia possesses several dimmer double stars and binary stars. Eta Cassiopeiae is a binary star with a period of 480 years. The primary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 3.5 and the secondary is a red-hued star of magnitude 7.5. The system is 19 light-years from Earth. Iota Cassiopeiae is a triple star 142 light-years from Earth. The primary is a white-hued star of magnitude 4.5, the secondary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 6.9, and the tertiary is a star of magnitude 8.4. The primary and secondary are close together but the primary and tertiary are widely separated. Sigma Cassiopeiae is a binary star 1500 light-years from Earth. It has a green-hued primary of magnitude 5.0 and a blue-hued secondary of magnitude 7.3. Psi Cassiopeiae is a triple star 193 light-years from Earth. The primary is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 4.7 and the secondary is a close pair of stars that appears to be of magnitude 9.0.</p>\r\n<p>Because it lies in rich Milky Way star fields, Cassiopeia contains many deep sky objects, including open clusters and nebulae.</p>\r\n<p>Two Messier objects, M52 (NGC 7654) and M103 (NGC 581), are located in Cassiopeia; both are open clusters. M52, once described as a "kidney-shaped" cluster, contains approximately 100 stars and is 5200 light-years from Earth. Its most prominent member is an orange-hued star of magnitude 8.0 near the cluster''s edge. M103 is far poorer than M52, with only about 25 stars included. It is also more distant, at 8200 light-years from Earth. Its most prominent member is actually a closer, superimposed double star; it consists of a 7th-magnitude primary and 10th-magnitude secondary.</p>\r\n<p>The other prominent open clusters in Cassiopeia are NGC 457 and NGC 663, both of which have about 80 stars. NGC 457 is looser, and its brightest member is Phi Cassiopeiae, a white-hued supergiant star of magnitude 5.0. The stars of NGC 457, arrayed in chains, are approximately 10,000 light-years from Earth. NGC 663 is both closer, at 8200 light-years from Earth, and larger, at 0.25 degrees in diameter.</p>\r\n<p>Planetary nebula IC 289 is a cloud of ionised gas being pushed out into space by the remnants of the star’s core.</p>\r\n<p>There are two supernova remnants in Cassiopeia. The first, which is unnamed, is the aftermath of the supernova called Tycho''s Star. It was observed in 1572 by Tycho Brahe and now exists as a bright object in the radio spectrum. Within the ''W'' asterism formed by Cassiopeia’s five major stars lies Cassiopeia A (Cas A). It is the remnant of a supernova that took place approximately 300 years ago (as observed now from Earth; it is 10,000 light-years away), and has the distinction of being the strongest radio source observable outside our solar system. It was perhaps observed as a faint star in 1680 by John Flamsteed. It was also the subject of the first image returned by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory in the late 1990s. The shell of matter expelled from the star is moving at 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi) per second; it has a temperature of 30,000 kelvin on average.</p>\r\n<p>Cassiopeia photographed from Wrightsville Beach, NC by Zach Rudisin.\r\nNGC 457 is another open cluster in Cassiopeia, also called the E.T. Cluster, the Owl Cluster, and Caldwell 13. The cluster was discovered in 1787 by William Herschel. It has an overall magnitude of 6.4 and is approximately 10,000 light-years from Earth, lying in the Perseus arm of the Milky Way. However, its most prominent member, the double star Phi Cassiopeiae, is far closer - between 1000 and 4000 light-years away. NGC 457 is fairly rich; it is a Shapley class e and Trumpler class I 3 r cluster. It is concentrated towards its center and detached from the star field. It contains more than 100 stars, which vary widely in brightness.</p>\r\n<p>Two members of the Local Group of galaxies are in Cassiopeia. NGC 185 is a magnitude 9.2 elliptical galaxy of type E0, 2 million light-years away.

(32, 'Cepheus', 'Cepheus is a constellation in the northern sky. It is named after Cepheus, King of Aethiopia in Greek mythology. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Its brightest star is Alpha Cephei with an apparent magnitude of 3.5. Delta Cephei is the prototype of an important class of star known as a Cepheid variable. RW Cephei, an orange hypergiant, together with the red supergiants Mu Cephei, VV Cephei and V354 Cephei are among the largest stars known. In addition, Cepheus also has the hyperluminous quasar S5 0014+81, hosting an ultramassive black hole in its core at 40 billion solar masses, about 10,000 times more massive than the central black hole of the Milky Way, making it the most massive black hole known in the universe.\r\n<p>Cepheus was the King of Aethiopia. He was married to Cassiopeia and was the father of Andromeda, both of whom are immortalized as modern day constellations along with Cepheus.</p>\r\n<p>Delta Cephei is the prototype Cepheid variable, a yellow-hued supergiant star 980 light-years from Earth. It was discovered to be variable by John Goodricke in 1784. It varies between 3.5<sup>m</sup> and 4.4<sup>m</sup> over a period of 5 days and 9 hours. The Cepheids are a class of pulsating variable stars; Delta Cephei has a minimum size of 40 solar diameters and a maximum size of 46 solar diameters. It is also a double star; the yellow star also has a wide-set blue-hued companion of magnitude 6.3.</p>\r\n<p>There are several other prominent variable stars in Cepheus. One, μ Cephei, is also known as Herschel''s Garnet Star due to its deep red colour. It is a semiregular variable star with a minimum magnitude of 5.1 and a maximum magnitude of 3.4. Its period is approximately 2 years. The star is around 11.8 AU in radius. If it were placed at the centre of our Solar System, it would extend to the orbit of Saturn.[citation needed] Another, VV Cephei A, like Mu Cephei, is a red supergiant and a semiregular variable star, located at least 5,000 light-years from Earth. It has a minimum magnitude of 5.4 and a maximum magnitude of 4.8. One of the largest stars in the galaxy, it has a diameter of 1,300 solar diameters. VV Cephei is also an unusually long-period eclipsing binary, but the eclipses, which occur every 20.3 years, are too faint to be observed with the unaided eye. T Cephei, also a red giant, is a Mira variable with a minimum magnitude of 11.3 and a maximum magnitude of 5.2, 685 light-years from Earth. It has a period of 13 months and a diameter of 500 solar diameters.</p>\r\n<p>There are several prominent double stars and binary stars in Cepheus. Omicron Cephei is a binary star with a period of 800 years. The system, 211 light-years from Earth, consists of an orange-hued giant primary of magnitude 4.9 and a secondary of magnitude 7.1. Xi Cephei is another binary star, 102 light-years from Earth, with a period of 4000 years. It has a blue-white primary of magnitude 4.4 and a yellow secondary of magnitude 6.5.</p>\r\n<p>Kruger 60 is an 11th magnitude binary star consisting of two red dwarfs. The star system is one of the nearest, being only 13 light years away from Earth.</p>\r\n    <p>NGC 188 is an open cluster that has the distinction of being the closest open cluster to the north celestial pole, as well as one of the oldest known open clusters.</p>\r\n    <p>The Fireworks Galaxy (NGC 6946) is a spiral galaxy in which nine supernovae have been observed, more than in any other galaxy.</p>\r\n    <p.IC 469 is another spiral galaxy, characterized by a compact nucleus, of oval shape, with perceptible side arms.</p>\r\n    <p>The nebula NGC 7538 is home to the largest yet discovered protostar.</p>\r\n    <p>NGC 7023 is a reflection nebula with an associated star cluster (Collinder 429); it has an overall magnitude of 7.7 and is 1400 light-years from Earth. The nebula and cluster are located near Beta Cephei and T Cephei.</p>\r\n    <p>The quasar 6C B0014+8120 is one of the most powerful objects in the universe, powered by a supermassive black hole equivalent to 40 billion Suns.</p>\r\n', '588 sq. deg.

(33, 'Lynx', 'Lynx is a constellation in the northern sky, introduced in the 17th century by Johannes Hevelius. It is named after the lynx, a genus of cats. It is mostly a very faint constellation; its brightest stars form a zigzag line.\r\nJohannes Hevelius defined the constellation in the 17th century as he wanted to fill the open gap between the constellations Ursa Major and Auriga. He supposedly named it Lynx because of its faintness: only the lynx-eyed (or those of good sight) would have been able to recognize it. Hevelius gave it the alternate name of Tiger in his catalogue as well as Lynx, but kept the latter name only in his atlas. Flamsteed adopted the constellation in his catalogue and atlas.\r\n<p>According to Richard H. Allen, the chief stars in Lynx "might well have been utilized by the modern constructor, whoever he was, of our Ursa Major to complete the quartette of feet."</p>\r\n<p>Francis Baily gave a single star a Bayer designation—Alpha Lyncis—the only star above magnitude 4.5. Flamsteed numbered 44 stars, though several lie across the boundary in Ursa Major. The brightest star in this constellation is Alpha Lyncis, an orange giant of spectral type K7III located 203 ± 2 light-years distant from Earth. The only named star is Alsciaukat (from the Arabic for thorn), also known as 31 Lyncis, or κ Lyncis.</p>\r\n<p>Five star systems have been found to contain exoplanets.</p>\r\n<p>Lynx''s most notable deep sky object is the Intergalactic Tramp NGC 2419, also called the "Intergalactic Wanderer", a globular cluster that is one of the most distant known of its kind at a distance of 300,000 light-years from Earth. It is likely that NGC 2419 is in a highly elliptical orbit around the Milky Way. It has a magnitude of 10.3 and is a Shapley class II cluster; the classification indicates that it is extremely concentrated at its center. Originally thought to be a star, NGC 2419 was discovered to be a globular cluster by Carl Lampland.</p>\r\n<p>Lynx has been used for the name of four United States Navy ships: USS Lynx (1814), USS Lynx (SP-2), USS Lynx (AK-100) and USS Lynx II (SP-730), of which only USS Lynx (AK-100) was named for the constellation.</p>', '545 sq. deg.

(34, 'Libra', 'Libra /ˈliːbrə/ is a constellation of the zodiac. Its name is Latin for weighing scales, and its symbol is (Unicode ♎). It is fairly faint, with no first magnitude stars, and lies between Virgo to the west and Scorpius to the east.\r\n<p>The brightest stars in Libra form a quadrangle that distinguishes it for the unaided observer. Traditionally, Alpha and Beta Librae are considered to represent the scales'' balance beam, while Gamma and Sigma are the weighing pans.\r\nAlpha Librae, called Zubenelgenubi, is a binary star divisible in binoculars, 77 light-years from Earth. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.7 and the secondary is a white star of magnitude 5.2. Its traditional name means "the southern claw". Zubeneschamali (Beta Librae) is the corresponding "northern claw" to Zubenelgenubi. The brightest star in Libra, it is a green-tinged star of magnitude 2.6, 160 light-years from Earth. Gamma Librae is called Zubenelakrab, which means "the scorpion''s claw", completing the suite of names referring to Libra''s archaic status. It is an orange giant of magnitude 3.9, 152 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Iota Librae is a complex multiple star, 377 light-years from Earth, with both optical and true binary components. The primary appears as a blue-white star of magnitude 4.5; it is a binary star indivisible in even the largest amateur instruments with a period of 23 years. The secondary, visible in small telescopes as a star of magnitude 9.4, is a binary with two components, magnitudes 10 and 11. There is an optical companion to Iota Librae; 25 Librae is a star of magnitude 6.1, 219 light-years from Earth and visible in binoculars. Mu Librae is a binary star divisible in medium-aperture amateur telescopes, 235 light-years from Earth. The primary is of magnitude 5.7 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.8.</p>\r\n<p>Delta Librae is an Algol-type eclipsing variable star, 304 lightyears from Earth. It has a period of 2 days, 8 hours; its minimum magnitude of 5.9 and its maximum magnitude is 4.9. FX Librae, designated 48 Librae, is a shell star of magnitude 4.9. Shell stars, like Pleione and Gamma Cassiopeiae, are blue supergiants with irregular variations caused by their abnormally high speed of rotation. This ejects gas from the star''s equator.</p>\r\n<p>Sigma Librae was formerly known as Gamma Scorpii despite being well inside the boundaries of Libra. It was not redesignated as Sigma Librae until 1851 by Benjamin A. Gould.</p>\r\n<p>Libra is home to the star Gliese 581, which has a planetary system consisting of at least 6 planets. Both Gliese 581 d, and Gliese 581 g are debatably the most promising candidates for life, although Gliese 581 g''s existences has been disputed and has not been entirely confirmed or agreed on in the scientific community. Gliese 581 c is considered to be the first Earth-like extrasolar planet to be found within its parent star''s habitable zone. Gliese 581 e is possibly the smallest mass exoplanet orbiting a normal star found to date  All of these exoplanets are of significance for establishing the likelihood of life outside of the Solar System.</p>\r\n<p>The family of candidate habitable planets was extended in late September 2010 to include exoplanets around red dwarf stars because of Gliese 581 g, which is a tidally locked planet in the middle of the habitable zone. Weather studies show that tidally locked planets may still have the ability to support life.</p>\r\n<p>Libra is home to one bright globular cluster, NGC 5897. It is a loose cluster, 40,000 light-years from Earth; it is fairly large and has an integrated magnitude of 9.</p>\r\n<p>Libra was known in Babylonian astronomy as MUL Zibanu (the "scales" or "balance"), or alternatively as the Claws of the Scorpion. The scales were held sacred to the sun god Shamash, who was also the patron of truth and justice. It was also seen as the Scorpion''s Claws in ancient Greece. Since these times, Libra has been associated with law, fairness and civility. In Arabic zubānā means "scorpion''s claws", and likely similarly in other Semitic languages: this resemblance of words may be why the Scorpion''s claws became the Scales.[citation needed] It has also been suggested that the scales are an allusion to the fact that when the sun entered this part of the ecliptic at the autumnal equinox, the days and nights are equal. Libra''s status as the location of the equinox earned the equinox the name "First Point of Libra", though its position ended in 730 because of the precession of the equinoxes.</p>\r\n<p>Libra is a constellation not mentioned by Eudoxus or Aratus. In Roman mythology, Libra is considered to depict the scales held by Astraea (identified as Virgo), the goddess of justice. Libra is mentioned by Manetho (3rd century B.C.) and Geminus (1st century B.C.), and included by Ptolemy in his 48 asterisms. Ptolemy catalogued 17 stars, Tycho Brahe 10, and Johannes Hevelius 20. It only became a constellation in ancient Rome, when it began to represent the scales held by Astraea, associated with Virgo.</p>\r\n<p>Libra is the only zodiac sign that does not symbolize a living creature.</p>', '538 sq. deg.

(35, 'Cancer', 'Cancer is one of the twelve constellations of the zodiac. Its name is Latin for crab and it is commonly represented as one. Its astrological symbol is (Unicode ♋). Cancer is a medium-size constellation with an area of 506 square degrees and its stars are rather faint, its brightest star Beta Cancri having an apparent magnitude of 3.5. It contains two stars with known planets, including 55 Cancri, which has five: one super-earth and four gas giants, one of which is in the habitable zone and as such has expected temperatures similar to Earth. Located at the center of the constellation is Praesepe (Messier 44), one of the closest open clusters to Earth and a popular target for amateur astronomers.\r\n<p>Cancer is a medium-sized constellation that is bordered by Gemini to the west, Lynx to the north, Leo Minor to the northeast, Leo to the east, Hydra to the south, and Canis Minor to the southwest. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is ''Cnc''. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 sides (illustrated in infobox). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 07<sup>h</sup> 55<sup>m</sup> 19.7973<sup>s</sup> and 09<sup>h</sup> 22<sup>m</sup> 35.0364<sup>s</sup>, while the declination coordinates are between 33.1415138° and 6.4700689°. Covering 506 square degrees or 0.921% of the sky, it ranks 31st of the 88 constellations in size. It can be seen at latitudes between +90° and -60° and is best visible at 9 p.m. during the month of March.</p>\r\n<p>Cancer is the dimmest of the zodiacal constellations, having only two stars above the fourth magnitude. The German cartographer Johann Bayer used the Greek letters Alpha through Omega to label the most prominent stars in the constellation, followed by the letters A, then lowercase b, c and d.\r\nAlso known as Altarf, Beta Cancri is the brightest star in Cancer at apparent magnitude 3.5 and located 290 light-years from Earth. It is a binary star system, its main component an orange giant of spectral type K4III that is varies slightly from a baseline magnitude of 3.53—dipping by 0.005 magnitude over a period of 6 days. An aging star, it has expanded to around 50 times the Sun''s diameter and shines with 660 times its luminosity. It has a faint magnitude 14 red dwarf companion located 29 seconds away that takes 76,000 years to complete an orbit. Altarf represents a part of Cancer''s body.\r\nAt magnitude 3.9 is Delta Cancri, also known as Asellus Australis. Located 131±1 light-years from Earth, it is an orange-hued giant star that has swollen and cooled off the main sequence to become an orange giant with a radius 11 times and luminosity 53 times that of the Sun. Its common name means "southern donkey". The star also holds a record for the longest name, "Arkushanangarushashutu," derived from ancient Babylonian language, which translates to "the southeast star in the Crab." Delta Cancri also makes it easy to find X Cancri, the reddest star in the sky. Known as Asellus Borealis "northern donkey", Gamma Cancri is a white-hued A-type subgiant of spectral type A1IV and magnitude 4.67, that is 35 times as luminous as of the Sun. It is located 181 ± 2 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Iota Cancri is a wide double star. The primary is a yellow-hued G-type bright giant star of magnitude 4.0, around 300 light-years from Earth. It spent much of its stellar life as a B-type main sequence star before expanding and cooling to its current state as it spent its core hydrogen. The secondary is a white main sequence star of spectral type A3V and magnitude 6.57. Despite having different distances when measured by the HIPPARCOS satellite, the two stars share a common proper motion and appear to be a natural binary system.\r\nLocated 174 ± 9 light-years from Earth, Alpha Cancri (Acubens) is a multiple star with a primary component an apparent white main sequence star of spectral type A5 and magnitude 4.26. The secondary is of magnitude 12.0 and is visible in small amateur telescopes. Its common name means "the claw". The primary is actually two very similar white main sequence stars that are 5.3 AU distant from each other and the secondary is two small main sequence stars, most likely red dwarfs, that are 600 AU from the main pair. Hence the system is a quadruple one.</p>\r\n<p>Zeta Cancri or Tegmine ("the shell") is a multiple star system that contains at least four stars located 83 light-years from Earth. The two brightest components are a binary star with an orbital period of 1100 years; the brighter component is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 70000.0 and the dimmer component is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 6.2. The brighter component is itself a binary star with a period of 59.5 years; its primary is of magnitude 5.6 and its secondary is of magnitude 6.0. This pair will be at its greatest separation in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Ten star systems have been found to have planets. Rho-1 Cancri or 55 Cancri is a binary star approximately 40.9 light-years distant from Earth. 55 Cancri consists of a yellow dwarf and a smaller red dwarf, with five planets orbiting the primary star; one low-mass planet that may be either a hot, water-rich world or a carbon planet and four gas giants. 55 Cancri A, classified as a rare "super metal-rich" star, is one of the top 100 target stars for NASA’s Terrestrial Planet Finder mission, ranked 63rd on the list. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B, a suspected binary, appears to be gravitationally bound to the primary star, as the two share common proper motion.</p>\r\n<p>YBP 1194 is a sunlike star in the open cluster M67 that has been found to have three planets.</p>', '506 sq. deg.

(36, 'Vela', 'Vela is a constellation in the southern sky. Its name is Latin for the sails of a ship, and it was originally part of a larger constellation, the ship Argo Navis, which was later divided into three or four parts, the others being Carina, Puppis and, according to some authorities, Pyxis. With an apparent magnitude of 1.8, its brightest star is the hot blue multiple star Gamma Velorum, one component of which is the brightest Wolf-Rayet star in the sky. Delta and Kappa Velorum, together with Epsilon and Iota Carinae, form the asterism known as the False Cross. 1.95-magnitude Delta is actually a triple or quintuple star system.\r\n<p>Argo Navis was one of the 48 classical constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and represented the ship Argo, used by Jason and the Argonauts on their quest for the Golden Fleece in Greek mythology. German cartographer Johann Bayer depicted the constellation on his Uranometria of 1603, and gave the stars Bayer designations from Alpha to Omega. However, his chart was inaccurate as the constellation was not visible from the Northern Hemisphere.</p>\r\n<p>Argo was more accurately charted and subdivided in 1752 by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, forming Carina, Vela, Puppis and Pyxis. Despite the division, Lacaille kept Argo''s Bayer designations. Therefore Carina has the Alpha, Beta and Epsilon, Vela has Gamma and Delta, Puppis has Zeta, and so on.</p>\r\n<p>Vela is bordered by Antlia and Pyxis to the north, Puppis to the northwest, Carina to the south and southwest, and Centaurus to the east. Covering 500 square degrees, it ranks 32nd of the 88 modern constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is "Vel".</p>\r\n<p>The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 14 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 08<sup>h</sup> 13.3<sup>m</sup> and 11<sup>h</sup> 05.5<sup>m</sup>, while the declination coordinates are between −37.16° and −57.17°.\r\n<p>The brightest star in the constellation, Gamma Velorum, is a complex multiple star system. The brighter component, known as Gamma2 Velorum or Regor, shines as a blue-white star of apparent magnitude 1.83. It is a spectroscopic binary made up of two very hot blue stars orbiting each other every 78.5 days and separated by somewhere between 0.8 and 1.6 Astronomical Units (AU). The brighter component is a hot blue main-sequence star of spectral type O7.5 and is around 280,000 times as luminous, is around 30 times as massive and is 17 times the diameter of our Sun with a surface temperature of 35,000 K. The second component is an extremely rare hot star known as a Wolf–Rayet star, and is the brightest example in the sky. It has a surface temperature of 57,000 and is around 170,000 times as luminous as our sun, though it radiates most of its energy in the ultraviolet spectrum. Gamma1 is a blue-white star of spectral type B2III and apparent magnitude 4.3. The two pairs are separated by 41 arcseconds, easily separable in binoculars. Parallax measurements give a distance of 1,116 light years, meaning that they are at least 12,000 AU apart. Further afield are 7.3-magnitude Gamma Velorum C and 9.4 magnitude Gamma Velorum D, lying 62 and 93 arcseconds southsoutheast from Gamma<sup>2</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>The next brightest star is Delta Velorum, also a multiple star system and one of the brightest eclipsing binaries in the sky. Together with Kappa Velorum, Iota and Epsilon Carinae, it forms the diamond-shaped asterism known as the False Cross—so called because it is sometimes mistaken for the Southern Cross, causing errors in astronavigation. Like the Southern Cross, three of its main four stars are whitish and one orange, but it is larger and fainter. Appearing as a white star of magnitude 1.95, Delta is actually a triple or possibly quintuple star system located around 80 light-years from our Solar System. Delta A has a magnitude of 1.99 and is an eclipsing binary composed of two A-type white stars (Delta Aa and Ab) which orbit each other every 45.2 days and lie 0.5 AU from each other, with a resulting drop in magnitude of 0.4 when the dimmer one passes.in front of the brighter. Delta B is a 5.1 magnitude yellow G-class star of similar dimensions to our sun which ranges between 26 and 72 AU away from the brighter pair, taking 142 years to complete a revolution. Further out still, at a distance of 1700 AU, are two red dwarfs of magnitudes 11 and 13. If they are part of the multiple system, they take 28000 years to complete and orbit. Also called Markeb, Kappa appears as a blue-white star of spectral type B2IV-V and magnitude 2.47 but is in fact a spectroscopic binary. The two orbit around each other with a period of 116.65 days, but the size, mass and nature of the companion are as yet unclear.</p>\r\n<p>The orange-hued Lambda Velorum, or Suhail, is the third brightest star in the constellation. A supergiant of spectral type K4Ib-II, it varies between magnitudes 2.14 and 2.3, and lies 545 light-years distant. It has around 11,000 times the luminosity, 9 to 12 times the mass and 207 times the diameter or our sun.</p>\r\n<p>AH Velorum is a Cepheid variable located less than a degree to the northeast of Gamma. A yellow-white supergiant of spectral type F7Ib-II, it pulsates between magnitudes 5.5 and 5.89 over 4.2 days. Also lying close to Gamma, V Velorum is a Cepheid of spectral type F6-F9II ranging from magnitude 7.2 to 7.9 over 4.4 days. AI Velorum is located 2.8 degrees northnortheast of Gamma, a Delta Scuti variable of spectral type A2p-F2pIV/V that ranges between magniudes 6.15 and 6.76 in around 2.7 hours.</p>\r\n<p>V390 Velorum is an aged star that has been found to be surrounded by a dusty disk. An RV Tauri variable, it has a spectral type of F3e and ranges between magnitudes 9.01 and 9.27 over nearly 95 days.</p>\r\n<p>Omicron Velorum is a blue-white subgiant of spectral type B3III-IV located around 495 light-years from our Solar System. A slowly pulsating B star, it ranges between magnitudes 3.57 and 3.63 over 2.8 days. It is the brightest star in, and gives its name to, the Omicron Velorum Cluster, also known as IC 2391, an open cluster located around 500 light-years away.</p>\r\n<p>Seven star systems have been found to have planets. HD 75289 is a sunlike star of spectral type G0V with a hot Jupiter planetary companion that takes only about 3.51 days to revolve at an orbital distance of 0.0482 AU.

(37, 'Carina', 'Carina /kəˈraɪnə/ is a constellation in the southern sky. Its name is Latin for the keel of a ship, and it was formerly part of the larger constellation of Argo Navis (the ship Argo) until that constellation was divided into three pieces, the other two being Puppis (the poop deck), and Vela (the sails of the ship).\r\n<p>Carina was once a part of Argo Navis, the great ship of Jason and the Argonauts who searched for the Golden Fleece. The constellation of Argo was introduced in ancient Greece. However, Nicolas Louis de Lacaille divided Argo into three component constellations in 1763, including Carina, the Keel.\r\nDespite the division, Lacaille kept Argo''s Bayer designations. Therefore, Carina has the α, β and ε, Vela has γ and δ, Puppis has ζ, and so on.\r\nCarina contains Canopus, a white-hued supergiant that is the second brightest star in the night sky at magnitude −0.72, 313 light-years from Earth. Alpha Carinae, as Canopus is formally designated, is a variable star that varies by approximately 0.1 magnitudes. Its traditional name comes from the mythological Canopus, who was a navigator for Menelaus, king of Sparta.</p>\r\n<p>There are several other stars above magnitude 3 in Carina. Beta Carinae, traditionally called Miaplacidus, is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 1.7, 111 light-years from Earth. Epsilon Carinae is an orange-hued giant star similarly bright to Miaplacidus at magnitude 1.9; it is 630 light-years from Earth. Another fairly bright star is the blue-white hued Theta Carinae; it is a magnitude 2.7 star 440 light-years from Earth. Theta Carinae is also the most prominent member of the cluster IC 2602. Iota Carinae is a white-hued supergiant star of magnitude 2.2, 690 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Eta Carinae is the most prominent variable star in Carina; it weighs in at approximately 100 solar masses and is 4 million times as bright as the Sun. It was first discovered to be unusual in 1677, when its magnitude suddenly rose to 4, attracting the attention of Edmond Halley. Eta Carinae is inside NGC 3372, commonly called the Carina Nebula. It had a long outburst in 1827, when it brightened to magnitude 1, only fading to magnitude 1.5 in 1828. Its most prominent outburst made Eta Carinae the equal of Sirius; it brightened to magnitude −1.5 in 1843. However, since 1843, Eta Carinae has remained relatively placid, having a magnitude between 6.5 and 7.9. However, in 1998, it brightened again, though only to magnitude 5.0, a far less drastic outburst. Eta Carinae is a binary star, with a companion that has a period of 5.5 years; the two stars are surrounded by the Homunculus Nebula, which is composed of gas that was ejected in 1843.</p>\r\n<p>There are several less prominent variable stars in Carina. l Carinae is a Cepheid variable noted for its brightness; it is the brightest Cepheid that is variable to the unaided eye. It is a yellow-hued supergiant star with a minimum magnitude of 4.2 and a maximum magnitude of 3.3; it has a period of 35.5 days.\r\nTwo bright Mira variable stars are in Carina: R Carinae and S Carinae; both stars are red giants. R Carinae has a minimum magnitude of 10.0 and a maximum magnitude of 4.0. Its period is 309 days and it is 416 light-years from Earth. S Carinae is similar, with a minimum magnitude of 10.0 and a maximum magnitude of 5.0. However, S Carinae has a shorter period – 150 days, though it is much more distant at 1300 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Carina is home to several double stars and binary stars. Upsilon Carinae is a binary star with two blue-white hued giant components, 1600 light-years from Earth. The primary is of magnitude 3.0 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.0; the two components are distinguishable in a small amateur telescope.</p>\r\n<p>Two asterisms are prominent in Carina. One is known as the ''Diamond Cross'', which is larger than the Southern Cross (but fainter), and, from the perspective of the southern hemisphere viewer, upside down, the long axes of the two crosses being close to parallel.[citation needed] Another asterism in the constellation is the False Cross, often mistaken for the Southern Cross, which is an asterism in Crux. The False Cross consists of two stars in Carina, Iota Carinae and Epsilon Carinae, and two stars in Vela, Kappa Velorum and Delta Velorum.</p>\r\n<p>Carina is known for its namesake nebula, NGC 3372, discovered by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751, which contains several nebulae. The Carina Nebula overall is a colossal emission nebula approximately 8,000 light-years away and 300 light-years wide that possesses vast star-forming regions; it has an overall magnitude of 8.0. It also has a massive apparent diameter, more than 2 degrees. Its central region is called the Keyhole Nebula, named in 1847 by John Herschel. The Keyhole is about seven light-years wide and is mostly made up of ionized hydrogen, with two major star-forming regions. The Homunculus Nebula is a planetary nebula visible to the naked eye that is being ejected by the erratic luminous blue variable star Eta Carinae, the most massive visible star known. Eta Carinae is so massive that it has reached the theoretical upper limit for the mass of a star and is therefore unstable. It is known for its outbursts; in 1840 it briefly became one of the brightest stars in the sky due to a particularly massive outburst, which largely created the Homunculus Nebula. Because of this instability and history of outbursts, Eta Carinae is considered a prime supernova candidate for the next several hundred thousand years because it has reached the end of its estimated million-year life span.</p>\r\n<p>Since the Milky Way runs through Carina, there are a large number of open clusters in the constellation, embedded in rich star fields. NGC 2516 is an open cluster that is both quite large–approximately half a degree square–and bright, visible to the unaided eye. It is located 1100 light-years from Earth and has approximately 80 stars, the brightest of which is a red giant star of magnitude 5.2. NGC 3114 is another open cluster approximately of the same size, though it is more distant at 3000 light-years from Earth. It is more loose and dim than NGC 2516, as its brightest stars are only 6th magnitude. The most prominent open cluster in Carina is IC 2602, also called the "Southern Pleiades". It contains Theta Carinae, along with several other stars visible to the unaided eye, in total, the cluster possesses approximately 60 stars. The Southern Pleiades is particularly large for an open cluster, with a diameter of approximately one degree. Like IC 2602, NGC 3532 is visible to the unaided eye and is of comparable size. It possesses approximately 150 stars that are arranged in an unusual shape, approximating an ellipse with a dark central area. Several prominent orange giants are among the cluster''s bright stars, of the 7th magnitude. Superimposed on the cluster is Chi Carinae, a yellow-white hued star of magnitude 3.9, far more distant than NGC 3532.</p>\r\n<p>Carina also contains the naked-eye globular cluster NGC 2808. Epsilon Carinae and Upsilon Carinae are double stars visible in small telescopes.</p>\r\n<p>One noted galaxy cluster is 1E 0657-56, the Bullet Cluster. At a distance of 4 billion light years (redshift 0.296), this galaxy cluster is named for the shock wave seen in the intracluster medium, which resembles the shock wave of a supersonic bullet. The bow shock visible is thought to be due to the smaller galaxy cluster moving through the intracluster medium at a relative speed of 3000–4000 kilometers per second to the larger cluster. Because this gravitational interaction has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years, the smaller cluster is being destroyed and will eventually merge with the larger cluster.</p>', '494 sq. deg.

(38, 'Monoceros', 'Monoceros (Greek: Μονόκερως) is a faint constellation on the celestial equator. Its name is Greek for unicorn. Its definition is attributed to the 17th-century Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius. It is bordered by Orion to the west, Gemini to the north, Canis Major to the south and Hydra to the east. Other bordering constellations include Canis Minor, Lepus and Puppis.\r\n<p>Monoceros is a constellation that is not very easily seen with the naked eye, with only a few fourth magnitude stars. Alpha Monocerotis has a visual magnitude of 3.93, slightly brighter than Gamma Monocerotis at 3.98.</p>\r\n<p>However, Monoceros does have some interesting features to observe with the aid of a small telescope. Beta Monocerotis is an impressive triple star system, the three stars forming a triangle which seems to be fixed. The visual magnitudes of the stars are 4.7, 5.2 and 6.1. William Herschel discovered it in 1781 and commented that it is "one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens".\r\nEpsilon Monocerotis is a fixed binary, with visual magnitudes of 4.5 and 6.5.\r\nS Monocerotis, or 15 Monocerotis, is a bluish white variable star and is located at the center of NGC 2264. The variation in its magnitude is slight (4.2–4.6). It has a companion star of visual magnitude 8.</p>\r\n<p>V838 Monocerotis, a variable red supergiant star, had an outburst starting on January 6, 2002; in February of that year, its brightness increased by a factor of 10,000 in one day. After the outburst was over, the Hubble Space Telescope was able to observe a light echo, which illuminated the dust surrounding the star.</p>\r\n<p>Monoceros also contains Plaskett''s Star, which is a massive binary system whose combined mass is estimated to be that of almost 100 Suns put together.\r\nMonoceros contains two super-Earth exoplanets in one planetary system: COROT-7b was detected by the COROT satellite and COROT-7c was detected by HARPS from ground-based telescopes. Until the announcement of Kepler-10b in January 2011, COROT-7b was the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter measured, at 1.58 times that of the Earth (which would give it a volume 3.95 times Earth''s). Both planets in this system were discovered in 2009.</p>\r\n<p>Monoceros contains many clusters and nebulae, most notable among them:</p>\r\n    <p>M50, an open cluster</p>\r\n    <p>The Rosette Nebula (NGC 2237, 2238, 2239, and 2246) is a diffuse nebula in Monoceros. It has an overall magnitude of 6.0 and is 4900 light-years from Earth. The Rosette Nebula, over 100 light-years in diameter, has an associated star cluster and possesses many Bok globules in its dark areas. It was independently discovered in the 1880s by Lewis Swift (early 1880s) and Edward Emerson Barnard (1883) as they hunted for comets.</p>\r\n    <p>The Christmas Tree Cluster (NGC 2264) is another open cluster in Monoceros. Named for its resemblance to a Christmas tree, it is fairly bright at an overall magnitude of 3.9; it is 2400 light-years from Earth. The variable star S Monocerotis represents the tree''s trunk, while the variable star V429 Monocerotis represents its top.</p>\r\n    <p>The Cone Nebula (NGC 2264), associated with the Christmas Tree Cluster, is a very dim nebula that contains a dark conic structure. It appears clearly in photographs, but is very elusive in a telescope. The nebula contains several Herbig-Haro objects, which are small irregularly variable nebulae. They are associated with protostars.</p>\r\n    <p>NGC 2254 is an open cluster with an overall magnitude of 9.7, 7100 light-years from Earth. It is a Shapley class f and Trumpler class I 2 p cluster, meaning that it appears to be a fairly rich cluster overall, though it has fewer than 50 stars. It appears distinct from the background star field and is very concentrated at its center; its stars range moderately in brightness.</p>\r\n    <p>Hubble''s Variable Nebula (NGC 2261) is a nebula with an approximate magnitude of 10, 2500 light-years from Earth. Though it is named for Edwin Hubble, it was discovered in 1783 by William Herschel. Hubble''s Variable Nebula is illuminated by R Monocerotis, a young variable star embedded in the nebula; the star''s unique interaction with the material in the nebula makes it both an emission nebula and a reflection nebula. One hypothesis regarding their interaction is that the nebula and its illuminating star are a very early stage planetary system.</p>', '482 sq. deg.

(39, 'Sculptor', 'Sculptor is a small and faint constellation in the southern sky. It represents a sculptor. It was introduced by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century. He originally named it Apparatus Sculptoris (the sculptor''s studio), but the name was later shortened.\r\n<p>Sculptor is a small constellation bordered by Aquarius and Cetus to the north, Fornax to the east, Phoenix to the south, Grus to the southwest, and Piscis Austrinus to the west. The bright star Fomalhaut is nearby. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is ''Scl''. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 6 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 23<sup>h</sup> 06.4<sup>m</sup> and 01<sup>h</sup> 45.5<sup>m</sup>, while the declination coordinates are between −24.80° and −39.37°.</p>\r\n<p>No stars brighter than 3rd magnitude are located in Sculptor. This is explained by the fact that Sculptor contains the south galactic pole where stellar density is very low.[citation needed]</p>\r\n<p>The brightest star is Alpha Sculptoris, an SX Arietis-type variable star with a spectral type B7IIIp and an apparent magnitude of 4.3. R Sculptoris is a red giant that has been found to be surrounded by spirals of matter likely ejected around 1800 years ago.</p>\r\n<p>The constellation also contains the Sculptor Dwarf, a dwarf galaxy which is a member of the Local Group, as well as the Sculptor Group, the group of galaxies closest to the Local Group. The Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), a barred spiral galaxy and the largest member of the group, lies near the border between Sculptor and Cetus. Another prominent member of the group is the irregular galaxy NGC 55.</p>\r\n<p>One unique galaxy in Sculptor is the Cartwheel Galaxy, at a distance of 500 million light-years. The result of a merger around 300 million years ago, the Cartwheel Galaxy has a core of older, yellow stars, and an outer ring of younger, blue stars, which has a diameter of 100,000 light-years. The smaller galaxy in the collision is now incorporated into the core, after moving from a distance of 250,000 light-years. The shock waves from the collision sparked extensive star formation in the outer ring.</p>\r\n<p>USS Sculptor (AK-103) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after the constellation.</p>', '475 sq. deg.

(40, 'Phoenix', 'Phoenix is a minor constellation in the southern sky. Named after the mythical phoenix, it was first depicted on a celestial atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted the brighter stars and gave their Bayer designations in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly −39° to −57° declination, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of right ascension. The constellations Phoenix, Grus, Pavo and Tucana, are known as the Southern Birds.\r\n<p>The brightest star, Alpha Phoenicis, is named Ankaa, an Arabic word meaning ''the Phoenix''. It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is Beta Phoenicis, actually a binary system composed of two yellow giants with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. Nu Phoenicis has a dust disk, while the constellation has ten star systems with known planets and the recently discovered galaxy clusters El Gordo and the Phoenix Cluster—located 7.2 and 5.7 billion light years away respectively, two of the largest objects in the visible universe. Phoenix is the radiant of two annual meteor showers: the Phoenicids in December, and the July Phoenicids.</p>\r\n<p>Phoenix was the largest of the twelve constellations established by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer''s Uranometria of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalog the same year under the Dutch name Den voghel Fenicx, "The Bird Phoenix", symbolising the phoenix of classical mythology. One name of the brightest star Alpha Phoenicis—Ankaa—is derived from the Arabic العنقاء al-‘anqā’ "the phoenix", and was coined sometime after 1800 in relation to the constellation.\r\nCelestial historian Richard Allen noted that unlike the other constellations introduced by Plancius and La Caille, Phoenix has actual precedent in ancient astronomy, as the Arabs saw this formation as representing young ostriches, Al Ri''āl, or as a griffin or eagle. In addition, the same group of stars was sometimes imagined by the Arabs as a boat, Al Zaurak, on the nearby river Eridanus. He observed, "the introduction of a Phoenix into modern astronomy was, in a measure, by adoption rather than by invention."</p>\r\n<p>The Chinese incorporated Phoenix''s brightest star, Ankaa (Alpha Phoenicis), and stars from the adjacent constellation Sculptor to depict Bakui, a net for catching birds. Phoenix and the neighbouring constellation of Grus together were seen by Julius Schiller as portraying Aaron the High Priest. These two constellations, along with nearby Pavo and Tucana, are called the Southern Birds.</p>\r\n<p>Phoenix is a small constellation bordered by Fornax and Sculptor to the north, Grus to the west, Tucana to the south, touching on the corner of Hydrus to the south, and Eridanus to the east and southeast. The bright star Achernar is nearby. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is ''Phe''. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 23<sup>h</sup> 26.5<sup>m</sup> and 02<sup>h</sup> 25.0<sup>m</sup>, while the declination coordinates are between −39.31° and −57.84°. This means it remains below the horizon to anyone living north of the 40th parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and remains low in the sky for anyone living north of the equator. It is most visible from locations such as Australia and South Africa during late Southern Hemisphere spring. Most of the constellation lies within, and can be located by, forming a triangle of the bright stars Achernar, Fomalhaut and Beta Ceti—Ankaa lies roughly in the centre of this.</p>\r\n', '469 sq. deg.

(41, 'Canes Venatici', 'Canes Venatici /ˈkeɪniːz vɨˈnætɨsaɪ/ is one of the 88 official modern constellations. It is a small northern constellation that was created by Johannes Hevelius in the 17th century. Its name is Latin for "hunting dogs", and the constellation is often depicted in illustrations as representing the dogs of Boötes the Herdsman, a neighboring constellation.\r\n<p>The stars of Canes Venatici are not bright. In classical times, they were included by Ptolemy within the constellation Ursa Major in his star catalogue. α CVn was Ptolemy''s "28th of Ursa Major", and β CVn was his "29th of Ursa Major".[citation needed]</p>\r\n<p>In medieval times, the identification of these stars with the dogs of Boötes arose through a mistranslation. Some of Boötes''s stars were traditionally described as representing the club (Greek, Κολλοροβος) of Boötes. When the Greek astronomer Ptolemy''s Almagest was translated from Greek to Arabic, the translator Johannitius (following Alberuni) did not know the Greek word and rendered it as the nearest-looking Arabic word, writing العصى ذات الكلاب in ordinary unvowelled Arabic text "al-`aşā dhāt al-kullāb", which means "the spearshaft having a hook". When the Arabic text was translated into Latin, the translator Gerard of Cremona (probably in Spain) mistook the Arabic word كلاب for kilāb (the plural of كلب kalb), meaning "dogs", writing hastile habens canes ("spearshaft having dogs"). In 1533, the German astronomer Peter Apian depicted Boötes as having two dogs with him.</p>\r\n<p>These spurious dogs floated about the astronomical literature until Hevelius decided to specify their presence in the sky by making them a separate constellation in 1687. Hevelius chose the name Asterion (from the Greek ''αστέριον, meaning the "little star", the diminutive of ''αστηρ the "star", or adjective meaning "starry") for the northern dog and Chara (from the Greek χαρά, meaning "joy") for the southern dog, as Canes Venatici, the Hunting Dogs, in his star atlas. In his star catalogue, the Czech astronomer Bečvář assigned Asterion to β CVn and Chara to α CVn.</p>\r\n<p>Canes Venatici is bordered by Ursa Major to the north and west, Coma Berenices to the south, and Boötes to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is ''CVn''. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 14 sides. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 12<sup>h</sup> 06.2<sup>m</sup> and 14<sup>h</sup> 07.3<sup>m</sup>, while the declination coordinates are between +27.84° and +52.36°. Covering 465 square degrees, it ranks 38th of the 88 constellations in size.</p>\r\n<p>Canes Venatici contains no bright stars, α and β CVn being only of 3rd and 4th magnitude respectively. Flamsteed catalogued 25 stars in the constellation, labelling them 1 to 25 Canum Venaticorum, however 1 turned out to be in Ursa Major, 13 was in Coma Berenices and 22 did not exist.</p>\r\n    <p>α CVn (Cor Caroli) is the constellation''s brightest star, named by Sir Charles Scarborough in memory of King Charles I, the deposed king of Britain. Legend has it that α CVn was brighter than usual during the Restoration, as Charles II returned to England to take the throne. Cor Caroli is a wide double star, with a primary of magnitude 2.9 and a secondary of magnitude 5.6; the primary is 110 light-years from Earth. The primary also has an unusually strong variable magnetic field.</p>\r\n    <p>β CVn (Chara) is a yellow-hued main sequence star of magnitude 4.2, 27 light-years from Earth. Its common name comes from the word for "joy".</p>\r\n    <p>Y CVn (La Superba) is a semiregular variable star that varies between magnitudes 5.0 and 6.5 over a period of around 158 days. It is a carbon star and is famous for being deep red.</p>\r\n    <p>AM CVn, a very blue star of magnitude 14, is the prototype of a special class of cataclysmic variable stars, in which the companion star is a white dwarf, rather than a main sequence star.</p>\r\n    <p>RS CVn is the prototype of a special class of binary stars of chromospherically active and optically variable components.</p>\r\n<p>The Giant Void, an extremely large void (part of the universe containing very few galaxies) is within the vicinity of this constellation.

(42, 'Aries', 'Aries is one of the constellations of the zodiac. It is located in the northern celestial hemisphere between Pisces to the west and Taurus to the east. The name Aries is Latin for ram, and its symbol is (Unicode ♈), representing a ram''s horns. It is one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is a mid-sized constellation, ranking 39th overall size, with an area of 441 square degrees (1.1% of the celestial sphere).\r\n<p>Although Aries came to represent specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, the stars of Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), Sheratan (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), Mesarthim (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and 41 Arietis (also fourth magnitude). The few deep-sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids.</p>\r\n<p>Aries is now recognized as an official constellation, albeit as a specific region of the sky, by the International Astronomical Union. It was originally defined in ancient texts as a specific pattern of stars, and has remained a constellation since ancient times; it now includes the ancient pattern as well as the surrounding stars. In the description of the Babylonian zodiac given in the clay tablets known as the MUL.APIN, the constellation now known as Aries was the final station along the ecliptic. The MUL.APIN was a comprehensive table of the risings and settings of stars, which likely served as an agricultural calendar. Modern-day Aries was known as <sup>MUL</sup>LÚ.ḪUN.GÁ, "The Agrarian Worker" or "The Hired Man". Although likely compiled in the 12th or 11th century BC, the MUL.APIN reflects a tradition which marks the Pleiades as the vernal equinox, which was the case with some precision at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age. The earliest identifiable reference to Aries as a distinct constellation comes from the boundary stones that date from 1350 to 1000 BC. On several boundary stones, a zodiacal ram figure is distinct from the other characters present. The shift in identification from the constellation as the Agrarian Worker to the Ram likely occurred in later Babylonian tradition because of its growing association with Dumuzi the Shepherd. By the time the MUL.APIN was created—by 1000 BC—modern Aries was identified with both Dumuzi''s ram and a hired laborer. The exact timing of this shift is difficult to determine due to the lack of images of Aries or other ram figures.</p>\r\n<p>In ancient Egyptian astronomy, Aries was associated with the god Amon-Ra, who was depicted as a man with a ram''s head and represented fertility and creativity. Because it was the location of the vernal equinox, it was called the "Indicator of the Reborn Sun". During the times of the year when Aries was prominent, priests would process statues of Amon-Ra to temples, a practice that was modified by Persian astronomers centuries later. Aries acquired the title of "Lord of the Head" in Egypt, referring to its symbolic and mythological importance.</p>\r\n<p>Aries was not fully accepted as a constellation until classical times. In Hellenistic astrology, the constellation of Aries is associated with the golden ram of Greek mythology that rescued Phrixos and Helle on orders from Hermes, taking him to the land of Colchis. Phrixos and Helle were the son and daughter of King Athamas and his first wife Nephele. The king''s second wife, Ino, was jealous and wished to kill his children. To accomplish this, she induced a famine in Boeotia, then falsified a message from the Oracle of Delphi that said Phrixos must be sacrificed to end the famine. Athamas was about to sacrifice his son atop Mount Laphystium when Aries, sent by Nephele, arrived. Helle fell off of Aries''s back in flight and drowned in the Dardanelles, also called the Hellespont in her honor. After arriving, Phrixos sacrificed the ram to Zeus and gave the Fleece to Aeëtes of Colchis, who rewarded him with an engagement to his daughter Chalciope. Aeëtes hung its skin in a sacred place where it became known as the Golden Fleece and was guarded by a dragon. In a later myth, this Golden Fleece was stolen by Jason and the Argonauts.</p>\r\n<p>Historically, Aries has been depicted as a crouched, wingless ram with its head turned towards Taurus. Ptolemy asserted in his Almagest that Hipparchus depicted Alpha Arietis as the ram''s muzzle, though Ptolemy did not include it in his constellation figure. Instead, it was listed as an "unformed star", and denoted as "the star over the head". John Flamsteed, in his Atlas Coelestis, followed Ptolemy''s description by mapping it above the figure''s head. Flamsteed followed the general convention of maps by depicting Aries lying down. Astrologically, Aries has been associated with the head and its humors. It was strongly associated with Mars, both the planet and the god. It was considered to govern Western Europe and Syria, and to indicate a strong temper in a person.\r\nThe First Point of Aries, the location of the vernal equinox, is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BC. as a point south of Gamma Arietis. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the First Point of Aries has since moved into Pisces and will move into Aquarius by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.</p>\r\n<p>Medieval Muslim astronomers depicted Aries in various ways. Astronomers like al-Sufi saw the constellation as a ram, modeled on the precedent of Ptolemy. However, some Islamic celestial globes depicted Aries as a nondescript four-legged animal with what may be antlers instead of horns. Some early Bedouin observers saw a ram elsewhere in the sky; this constellation featured the Pleiades as the ram''s tail. The generally accepted Arabic formation of Aries consisted of thirteen stars in a figure along with five "unformed" stars, four of which were over the animal''s hindquarters and one of which was the disputed star over Aries''s head. Al-Sufi''s depiction differed from both other Arab astronomers'' and Flamsteed''s, in that his Aries was running and looking behind itself.</p>\r\n<p>The obsolete constellations introduced in Aries (Musca Borealis, Lilium, Vespa, and Apes) have all been composed of the northern stars. Musca Borealis was created from the stars 33 Arietis, 35 Arietis, 39 Arietis, and 41 Arietis. In 1612, Petrus Plancius introduced Apes, a constellation representing a bee. In 1624, the same stars were used by Jakob Bartsch to create a constellation called Vespa, representing a wasp. In 1679 Augustin Royer used these stars for his constellation Lilium, representing the fleur-de-lis. None of these constellation became widely accepted. Johann Hevelius renamed the constellation "Musca" in 1690 in his Firmamentum Sobiescianum. To differentiate it from Musca, the southern fly, it was later renamed Musca Borealis but it did not gain acceptance and its stars were ultimately officially reabsorbed into Aries.\r\nIn 1922, the International Astronomical Union defined its recommended three-letter abbreviation, "Ari". The official boundaries of Aries were defined in 1930 by Eugène Delporte as a polygon of 12 segments. Its right ascension is between 1<sup>h</sup> 46.4<sup>m</sup> and 3<sup>h</sup> 29.4<sup>m</sup> and its declination is between 10.36° and 31.22° in the equatorial coordinate system.</p>', '441 sq. deg.

(43, 'Grus', 'Grus (/ˈɡrʌs/, or colloquially /ˈɡruːs/) is a constellation in the southern sky. Its name is Latin for the crane, a type of bird. It is one of twelve constellations conceived by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. Grus first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer''s star atlas Uranometria of 1603. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave Bayer designations to its stars in 1756, some of which had been previously considered part of the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus. The constellations Grus, Pavo, Phoenix and Tucana are collectively known as the "Southern Birds".\r\nThe constellation''s brightest star, Alpha Gruis, is also known as Alnair and appears as a 1.7-magnitude blue-white star. Beta Gruis is a red giant variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. Six star systems have been found to have planets: the red dwarf Gliese 832 is one of the closest stars to Earth to have a planetary system. Another—WASP-95—has a planet that orbits every two days. Deep-sky objects found in Grus include the planetary nebula IC 5148, also known as the Spare Tyre Nebula, and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet.\r\n<p>The stars that form Grus were originally considered part of the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus (the southern fish), with Gamma Gruis seen as part of the fish''s tail. The stars were first defined as a separate constellation by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius, who created twelve new constellations based on the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the Eerste Schipvaart, to the East Indies. Grus first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. Its first depiction in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer''s Uranometria of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name Den Reygher, "The Heron", but Bayer followed Plancius and Hondius in using Grus.</p>\r\n<p>An alternative name for the constellation, Phoenicopterus (Latin "flamingo"), was used briefly during the early 17th century, seen in the 1605 work Cosmographiae Generalis by Paul Merula of Leiden University and a c. 1625 globe by Dutch globe maker Pieter van den Keere. Astronomer Ian Ridpath has reported the symbolism likely came from Plancius originally, who had worked with both of these people. Grus and the nearby constellations Phoenix, Tucana and Pavo are collectively called the "Southern Birds".</p>\r\n<p>The stars that correspond to Grus were generally too far south to be seen from China. In Chinese astronomy, Gamma and Lambda Gruis may have been included in the tub-shaped asterism Bàijiù, along with stars from Piscis Austrinus. In Central Australia, the Arrernte and Luritja people living on a mission in Hermannsburg viewed the sky as divided between them, east of the Milky Way representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps. Alpha and Beta Gruis, along with Fomalhaut, Alpha Pavonis and the stars of Musca, were all claimed by the Arrernte.</p>', '366 sq. deg.

(44, 'Lupus', 'Lupus /ˈljuːpəs/ is a constellation located in the deep southern sky. Its name is Latin for wolf. Lupus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations, although it was previously an asterism associated with the neighboring constellation Centaurus.\r\n<p>In ancient times, the constellation was considered an asterism within Centaurus, and was considered to have been an arbitrary animal, killed, or about to be killed, on behalf of, or for, Centaurus. An alternative visualization, attested by Eratosthenes, saw this constellation as a wineskin held by Centaurus. It was not separated from Centaurus until Hipparchus of Bithynia named it Therion (meaning beast) in the 3rd century BC. No particular animal was associated with it until the Latin translation of Ptolemy''s work identified it with the wolf.</p>\r\n<p>The Greek constellation is probably based on the Babylonian figure known as the Mad Dog (UR.IDIM). This was a strange hybrid creature that combined the head and torso of a man with the legs and tail of a lion (the cuneiform sign ''UR'' simply refers to a large carnivore; lions, wolves and dogs are all included). It is often found in association with the sun god and another mythical being called the Bison-man, which is supposedly related to the Greek constellation of Centaurus.</p>\r\n<p>Lupus is bordered by six different constellations, although one of them (Hydra) merely touches at the corner. The other five are Scorpius (the scorpion), Norma (the right angle), Circinus (the compass), Libra (the balance scale), and Centaurus (the centaur). Covering 333.7 square degrees and 0.809% of the night sky, it ranks 46th of the 88 modern constellations. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is Lup. The official constellation boundaries are defined by a twelve-sided polygon (illustrated in infobox). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 14<sup>h</sup> 17<sup>m</sup> 48.0635<sup>s</sup> and 16<sup>h</sup> 08<sup>m</sup> 36.6735<sup>s</sup>, while the declination coordinates are between −29.83° and −55.58°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 34°N.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, there are 127 stars within the constellation''s borders brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5. In his book Star Names and Their Meanings, R.H. Allen gave the names Yang Mun for Alpha Lupi, the brightest star in Lupus, and KeKwan for the blue giant Beta Lupi, both from Chinese. However, the first name is in error; both stars were part of a large Chinese constellation known in modern transliteration as Qíguān, the Imperial Guards.\r\nMost of the brightest stars in Lupus are massive members of the nearest OB association, Scorpius-Centaurus.</p>\r\n<p>Alpha Lupi is an ageing blue giant star of spectral type B1.5 III that is 460 ± 10 light-years distant from Earth. It is a Beta Cephei variable, pulsating in brightness by 0.03 of a magnitude every 7 hours and 6 minutes.</p>', '334 sq. deg.

(45, 'Capricornus', 'Capricornus /ˌkæprɨˈkɔrnəs/ is one of the constellations of the zodiac. Its name is Latin for "horned goat" or "goat horn", and it is commonly represented in the form of a sea-goat: a mythical creature that is half goat, half fish. Its symbol is Capricorn (Unicode ♑).\r\n<p>Capricornus is one of the 88 modern constellations, and was also one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. Under its modern boundaries it is bordered by Aquila, Sagittarius, Microscopium, Piscis Austrinus, and Aquarius. The constellation is located in an area of sky called the Sea or the Water, consisting of many water-related constellations such as Aquarius, Pisces and Eridanus. It is the smallest constellation in the zodiac.\r\nCapricornus is a faint constellation, with only one star above magnitude 3; its alpha star has a magnitude of only 3.6.</p>\r\n<p>The brightest star in Capricornus is δ Capricorni, also called Deneb Algedi, with a magnitude of 2.9, 39 light-years from Earth. Like several other stars such as Denebola and Deneb, it is named for the Arabic word for "tail" (deneb); its traditional name means "the tail of the goat". Deneb Algedi is a Beta Lyrae variable star (a type of eclipsing binary). It ranges by about 0.2 magnitudes with a period of 24.5 hours.</p>\r\n<p>The other bright stars in Capricornus range in magnitude from 3.1 to 5.1. α Capricorni is a multiple star also known as Algedi or Giedi. The primary (α<sup>2</sup> Cap), 109 light-years from Earth, is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 3.6.; the secondary (α<sup>1</sup> Cap), 690 light-years from Earth, is a yellow-hued supergiant star of magnitude 4.3. The two stars are distinguishable by the naked eye, and both are themselves multiple stars. α<sup>1</sup> Capricorni is accompanied by a star of magnitude 9.2; α<sup>2</sup> Capricornus is accompanied by a star of magnitude 11.0; this faint star is itself a binary star with two components of magnitude 11. The traditional names of α Capricorni come from the Arabic word for "the kid", which references the constellation''s mythology.</p>\r\n<p>β Capricorni is a double star also known as Dabih. It is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 3.1, 340 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 6.1. The two stars are distinguishable in binoculars. β Capricorni''s traditional name comes from the Arabic phrase for "the lucky stars of the slaughterer," a reference to ritual sacrifices performed by ancient Arabs at the heliacal rising of Capricornus. Another star visible to the naked eye is γ Capricorni, sometimes called Nashira ("bringing good tidings"); it is a white-hued giant star of magnitude 3.7, 139 light-years from Earth. π Capricorni is a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 5.1 and a white-hued secondary of magnitude 8.3. It is 670 light-years from Earth and the components are distinguishable in a small telescope.</p>\r\n<p>Several galaxies and star clusters are contained within Capricornus. Messier 30 is a globular cluster located 1 degree south of the galaxy group NGC 7103. The constellation also harbors the wide spiral galaxy NGC 6907.</p>\r\n<p>M30 (NGC 7099) is a centrally-condensed globular cluster of magnitude 7.5. At a distance of 30,000 light-years, it has chains of stars extending to the north that are resolvable in small amateur telescopes.</p>\r\n<p>One galaxy group located in Capricornus is HCG 87, a group of at least three galaxies located 400 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0296). It contains a large elliptical galaxy, a face-on spiral galaxy, and an edge-on spiral galaxy. The face-on spiral galaxy is experiencing abnormally high rates of star formation, indicating that it is interacting with one or both members of the group. Furthermore, the large elliptical galaxy and the edge-on spiral galaxy, both of which have active nuclei, are connected by a stream of stars and dust, indicating that they too are interacting. Astronomers predict that the three galaxies may merge millions of years in the future to form a giant elliptical galaxy.</p>\r\n<p>Despite its faintness, Capricornus has one of the oldest mythological associations, having been consistently represented as a hybrid of a goat and a fish since the Middle Bronze Age. First attested in depictions on a cylinder-seal from around the 21st century BC, it was explicitly recorded in the Babylonian star catalogues as <sup>MUL</sup>SUḪUR.MAŠ "The Goat-Fish" before 1000 BC. The constellation was a symbol of the god Ea and in the Early Bronze Age marked the winter solstice.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the precession of the equinoxes the December solstice no longer takes place while the sun is in the constellation Capricornus, as it did until 130 BCE, but the astrological sign called Capricorn begins with the solstice. The solstice now takes place when the Sun is in Sagittarius. The sun''s most southerly position, which is attained at the northern hemisphere''s winter solstice, is now called the Tropic of Capricorn, a term which also applies to the line on the Earth at which the sun is directly overhead at noon on that solstice. The Sun is now in Capricorn from late January through mid-February.\r\nIn Greek mythology, the constellation is sometimes identified as Amalthea, the goat that suckled the infant Zeus after his mother, Rhea, saved him from being devoured by his father, Cronos. The goat''s broken horn was transformed into the cornucopia or horn of plenty. Capricornus is also sometimes identified as Pan, the god with a goat''s head, who saved himself from the monster Typhon by giving himself a fish''s tail and diving into a river.</p>\r\n<p>The planet Neptune was discovered in Capricornus by German astronomer Johann Galle, near Deneb Algedi (δ Capricorni) on September 23, 1846, which is appropriate as Capricornus can be seen best from Europe at 4:00am in September.</p>', '414 sq. deg.

(46, 'Fornax', 'Fornax /ˈfɔrnæks/ is a constellation in the southern sky. Its name is Latin for furnace. It was named by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1756. Fornax is one of the 88 modern constellations.\r\n<p>De Lacaille originally called the constellation "Fornax Chemica" (the chemical furnace), representing a small solid fuel vessel used for heating chemical experiments.</p>\r\n<p>Alpha Fornacis is a binary star that can be resolved by small amateur telescopes. The primary is a yellow-tinged main-sequence star of magnitude 3.9 and the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 6.5; the secondary may actually be a variable star. It has a period of 300 years and is 46 light-years from Earth. Beta Fornacis is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 4.5, 169 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Fornax has been the target of investigations into the furthest reaches of the universe. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field is located within Fornax, and the Fornax Cluster, a small cluster of galaxies, lies primarily within Fornax. At a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society in Britain, a team from University of Queensland described 40 unknown "dwarf" galaxies in this constellation; follow-up observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory''s Very Large Telescope revealed that ultra compact dwarfs are much smaller than previously known dwarf galaxies, about 120 light-years (37 pc) across.</p>\r\n<p>NGC 1049 is a globular cluster 500,000 light-years from Earth. It is in the Fornax Dwarf Galaxy.</p>\r\n<p>UDFj-39546284, is a candidate protogalaxy located in Fornax, although recent analyses have suggested it is likely to be a lower redshift source.</p>\r\n<p>HIP 13044 b is an exoplanet in the constellation, reported in November 2010, that was discovered to have originated outside of the galaxy.</p>\r\n<p>NGC 1097 is a barred spiral galaxy in Fornax, about 60 million light-years from Earth. At magnitude 9, it is visible in medium amateur telescopes. It is notable as a Seyfert galaxy with strong spectral emissions indicating ionized gases and a central supermassive black hole.</p>\r\n<p>NGC 1365 is another barred spiral galaxy located at a distance of 60 million light-years from Earth. Like NGC 1097, it is also a Seyfert galaxy. Its bar is a center of star formation and shows extensions of the spiral arms'' dust lanes. The bright nucleus indicates the presence of an active galactic nucleus - a galaxy with a supermassive black hole at the center, accreting matter from the bar. It is a 10th magnitude galaxy associated with the Fornax Cluster.</p>\r\n<p>NGC 1360 is a planetary nebula in Fornax with a magnitude of approximately 9.0, 978 light-years from Earth. Its central star is of magnitude 11.4, an unusually bright specimen. It is five times the size of the famed Ring Nebula in Lyra at 6.5 arcminutes. Unlike the Ring Nebula, NGC 1360 is clearly elliptical.</p>\r\n<p>Fornax A is a radio galaxy with extensive radio lobes that corresponds to the optical galaxy NGC 1316, a 9th-magnitude galaxy. One of the closer active galaxies to Earth at a distance of 80 million light-years, Fornax A appears in the optical spectrum as a large elliptical galaxy with dust lanes near its core. These dust lanes have caused astronomers to discern that it recently merged with a small spiral galaxy. Because it has a high rate of type Ia supernovae, NGC 1316 has been used to determine the size of the universe. The jets producing the radio lobes are not particularly powerful, giving the lobes a more diffuse, knotted structure due to interactions with the intergalactic medium. Associated with this peculiar galaxy is an entire cluster of galaxies.\r\nThe Fornax Dwarf galaxy is a dwarf galaxy that is part of the Local Group of galaxies. It is not visible in amateur telescopes, despite its relatively small distance of 500,000 light-years.</p>\r\n<p>In Chinese astronomy, the stars that correspond to Fornax are located within the White Tiger of the West (西方白虎, Xī Fāng Bái Hǔ).</p>', '398 sq. deg.

(47, 'Coma Berenices', 'Coma Berenices is a traditional asterism that has since been defined as one of the 88 modern constellations. It is located near Arcturus, and the constellation Leo to which it formerly belonged, and contains the North Galactic Pole. Its name means "Berenice''s Hair" (in Greek, via Latin), and refers to the legend of Queen Berenice II of Egypt, who sacrificed her long hair.\r\n<p>Coma Berenices is one of the few constellations to owe its name to a historical figure, in this case Queen Berenice II of Egypt, wife of Ptolemy III Euergetes (fl. 246 BC–221 BC), the king under whom Alexandria became an important cultural center.</P>\r\n<p>In 243 BC, during the Third Syrian War, Ptolemy undertook a dangerous expedition against the Seleucids, who had murdered his sister. His newlywed bride, Berenice, swore to the goddess Aphrodite to sacrifice her long, blonde hair, of which she was extremely proud, if her husband returned safely. He did, so she cut her hair and placed it in the goddess''s temple. By the next morning the hair had disappeared. To appease the furious king the court astronomer, Conon, announced that the offering had so pleased the goddess that she had placed it in the sky. He indicated a cluster of stars that have since been called Berenice''s Hair.</p>\r\n<p>This incident inspired the court poet Callimachus of Cyrene to write a poem entitled Βερενίκης πλόκαμος (Greek "Berenice''s braid"). About 2/3 of the Greek original is now lost, but the full version was translated to Latin by the Roman poet Catullus, and his version exists to this day.</p>\r\n<p>Coma Berenices consists of a number of stars close together, and has been recognized as a distinct asterism since the Hellenistic period. Eratosthenes referred to it as both "Ariadne''s Hair" and "Berenice''s Hair". Ptolemy referred to it as "the lock" of hair; however, he did not list it as one of his 48 constellations, considering it to be a part of Leo, specifically, the tuft at the end of the lion''s tail.</p>\r\n<p>Tycho Brahe, who is usually given credit for Coma''s promotion to constellation status, listed it in his star catalogue of 1602, but it originally occurred on a celestial globe by the cartographer Caspar Vopel from 1536. Gerardus Mercator has also been credited as its promoter in 1551. Coma Berenices and the now-defunct constellation Antinous are considered to be the first post-Ptolemaic constellations to be depicted on a celestial globe.\r\nIt appeared in Johann Bayer''s Uranometria of 1603, and during the 17th century, a few other maps that were made of the sky followed suit.</p>\r\n<p>Although Coma Berenices is not a large constellation, it contains eight Messier objects. The constellation is rich in galaxies, containing the northern part of the Virgo cluster. There are also several globular clusters to be seen. These objects can be seen with minimal obscuration from dust because the constellation is not in the direction of the galactic plane (the North Pole of the galactic plane is in this constellation). However, because of this fact, there are few open clusters (except for the Coma Berenices Cluster, which dominates the northern part of the constellation), diffuse nebulae, or planetary nebulae.</p>\r\n<p>Coma Berenices is not particularly bright, having no stars brighter than fourth magnitude. Beta Comae Berenices is the brightest star in the constellation, at magnitude 4.2; it is 30 light-years from Earth. Like the Sun, it is a yellow-hued main-sequence star. It is intrinsically only slightly brighter than the Sun, which gives an idea of how faint the Sun would appear seen from Beta Comae''s distance.</p>\r\n<p>The second brightest star in Coma Berenices is α Comae Berenices also called Diadem. The name represents the gem in Berenice''s crown. It is a binary star, with two components of almost equal magnitude. To the naked eye, it appears to be one star of magnitude 4.3. Because the orbital plane is so close to the Earth''s line of sight, it was long suspected of being an eclipsing binary, but it now appears that the orbital tilt is 0.1° relative to the line of sight, so the stars do not eclipse each other as seen from Earth. The two components are slightly yellow-tinged; both are of magnitude 5.1. This binary has a period of 26 years and is 47 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Gamma Comae Berenices, which is superimposed on the Coma Star Cluster, is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 4.4, 170 light-years from Earth.\r\nThere are two other prominent multiple stars in Coma Berenices. 35 Comae Berenices is a binary star with an optical companion. The two physically related components have a period of 360 years and are 324 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 5.1 and the secondary is a white-hued star of magnitude 7.2. The optical tertiary component is of magnitude 9. 24 Comae Berenices is a double star with contrasting colors. The primary is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 5.0, 610 light-years from Earth, and the secondary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 6.6.</p>\r\n<p>Over 200 variable stars are known in Coma Berenices, although many of them are obscure. FK Comae Berenices, which varies between 8.14<sup>m</sup> and 8.33<sup>m</sup> over a period of 2.4 days, is the prototype for the FK Com class of variable stars. It is believed that the variability of FK Com stars is caused by large, cool spots on the rotating surfaces of the stars. FS Comae Berenices is a semi-regular variable, a red giant with a minimum magnitude of 6.1 and a maximum magnitude of 5.3. It has a period of approximately 2 months and is 572 light-years from Earth.</p>\r\n', '386 sq. deg.

(48, 'Pavo', 'Pavo is a constellation in the southern sky with the Latin name for peacock. It is one of twelve constellations conceived by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. Pavo first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer''s star atlas Uranometria of 1603. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave its stars Bayer designations in 1756. The constellations Pavo, Grus, Phoenix and Tucana are collectively known as the "Southern Birds".\r\nThe constellation''s brightest member, Alpha Pavonis, is also known as Peacock and appears as a 1.91-magnitude blue-white star, but is actually a spectroscopic binary. Delta Pavonis is a nearby Sun-like star some 19.9 light years distant. Six of the star systems in Pavo have been found to host planets, including HD 181433 with a super-earth, and HD 172555 with evidence of a major interplanetary collision in the past few thousand years. The constellation contains NGC 6752, the third-brightest globular cluster in the sky, and the spiral galaxy NGC 6744, which closely resembles our Milky Way but is twice as large. Pavo is the radiant of two annual meteor showers: the Delta Pavonids and August Pavonids.\r\n<p>Pavo was one of the twelve constellations established by Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius from the observations of the southern sky by Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the Eerste Schipvaart, to the East Indies. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius.</p>\r\n<p>The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in German cartographer Johann Bayer''s Uranometria of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name De Pauww, "The Peacock".</p>\r\n<p>Pavo and the nearby constellations Phoenix, Grus and Tucana are collectively called the "Southern Birds".</p>\r\n<p>An alternate Latin name for the constellation was Junonia Avis.</p>\r\nAccording to Mark Chartrand, former executive director of the National Space Institute, Plancius may not have been the first to designate this group of stars as a peacock: "In Greek myth the stars that are now the Peacock were Argos [or Argus], builder of the ship Argo. He was changed by the goddess Juno into a peacock and placed in the sky along with his ship." Indeed, the peacock "symboliz[ed] the starry firmament" for the Greeks, and the goddess Hera was believed to drive through the heavens in a chariot drawn by peacocks.</p>\r\n<p>The peacock and the "Argus" nomenclature are also prominent in a different myth, in which Io, a beautiful princess of Argos, was lusted after by Zeus (Jupiter). Zeus changed Io into a heifer to deceive his wife (and sister) Hera and couple with her. Hera saw through Zeus''s scheme and asked for the heifer as a gift. Zeus, unable to refuse such a reasonable request, reluctantly gave the heifer to Hera, who promptly banished Io and arranged for Argus Panoptes, a creature with one hundred eyes, to guard the now-pregnant Io from Zeus. Meanwhile, Zeus entreated Hermes to save Io; Hermes used music to lull Argus Panoptes to sleep, then slew him. Hera adorned the tail of a peacock—her favorite bird—with Argus''s eyes in his honor.</p>\r\n<p>As recounted in Ovid''s Metamorphoses, the death of Argus Panoptes also contains an explicit celestial reference: "Argus lay dead; so many eyes, so bright quenched, and all hundred shrouded in one night. Saturnia [Hera] retrieved those eyes to set in place among the feathers of her bird [the peacock, Pavo] and filled his tail with starry jewels."</p>\r\n<p>It is uncertain whether the Dutch astronomers had the Greek mythos in mind when creating Pavo but, in keeping with other constellations introduced by Plancius through Keyser and De Houtmann, the "peacock" in the new constellation likely referred to the green peacock, which the explorers would have encountered in the East Indies, rather than the blue peacock known to the ancient Greeks.</p>\r\n<p>The Wardaman people of the Northern Territory in Australia saw the stars of Pavo and the neighbouring constellation Ara as flying foxes.</p>', '378 sq. deg.

(1, 'Andromeda Galaxy', 2.54, 'spiral galaxy', 'The Andromeda Galaxy (/ænˈdrɒmɨdə/) is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years; 2.4×10<sup>19</sup> km) from Earth. Also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, it is often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts. The Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. It gets its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda. The Andromeda Galaxy is the largest galaxy of the Local Group, which also contains the Milky Way, the Triangulum Galaxy, and about 44 other smaller galaxies.\r\n\r\n<p>The Andromeda Galaxy is the most massive galaxy in the Local Group as well. Despite earlier findings that suggested that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and could be the most massive in the grouping, the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that Andromeda contains one trillion (1012) stars: at least twice the number of stars in the Milky Way, which is estimated to be 200–400 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be 1.5×10<sup>12</sup> solar masses, while the mass of the Milky Way is estimated to be 8.5×10<sup>11</sup> solar masses. In comparison, a 2009 study estimated that the Milky Way and M31 are about equal in mass, while a 2006 study put the mass of the Milky Way at ~80% of the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy. The two galaxies are expected to collide in 3.75 billion years, eventually merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy  or perhaps a large disk galaxy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At 3.4, the apparent magnitude of the Andromeda Galaxy is one of the brightest of any Messier objects, making it visible to the naked eye on moonless nights even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution. Although it appears more than six times as wide as the full Moon when photographed through a larger telescope, only the brighter central region is visible to the naked eye or when viewed using binoculars or a small telescope.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AaL1WPpBHBUo5_pQde26M36qgWd7EXg3LV01a2wacnULCFkIu_cpwLzgxtnFahJuGqWG_dsPZZnL2z6mblCYdH_dQigOcafYtCrB7WnedIhFMSsw_TaCREgwZGJsEJTISsvZuev8ZbhIqKs9TLFrwAi0nYeJEMrgRAJaBvN3LoAAV01n6YTxDpFGjOwfv8mvpDdx3QEUIpduyl5_DAqBx7mnmaJTEXV5xX3cZavXvoC50WwpxtEbPVt5mEVQXGjlqROLzEZ8HeodNzHzv-UphbTYaH4Pf016Ozuk-6OD0rjeIaQSi2WLf0hUcW6GTU4ZwEl9iAZpIcNUnZZeNlvFCOD8Sd1By0pNHok3tTfNksNke1wRZjXdyUV7laCor7XJa_4kDW26OLqgmlau6uUoIrJfyEksJ5lFT7GnRdhK-eM1zo7i85Vipt0PfUwY1q8dOQE_OnUHEIDW3DGta0Vb6Rmocg2DPuBcdTmv_7syNQn13oxCzyL4d9feglvJas48xdcB5zkM2DWvR_Qv8WE8GRUP3UFcUB0r9-16qgW4NZY=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OKEwjNu2lvWf3c60SsmR5QEs4XDi4Zg1_iInLWbt2z-c8oWXSV6DQ6TXWTWa1cfeRNQ2aMvBS-JkJulyXwb9DIqiG4kE4xfbFiwx2nwcc0FCiXm4f0ldj7S5FgqJLO16ii02KhZPIOVjVsiksrctfFpqARLOE6RS2pE9ZoO3q_36us5GBw9vF0zhBQmdwazVfivwkAV0VbFnztyX7NyUayUgC5ysBR-7-C9SuR58vhMTCQytCO7ml_gV-NNq0qDs64XZGaP8hSmu3N_u_nmswCRI9SP_5njkSRRBuEENuPtQzz39qKbS6dEyfGa3f2_Zuh3TiKVDRvoXTHGFE7MoE5SfqRTNDXCsN2d4B9-yo2nl-uoYsrgBc6QjsE8nOAyukoQJNOpZWg7fiIWDgLUzCCakTEtfQnp766HIC6ZnzROFjadBmgEQPuouekeopHMWKYSWtcqCaCxTrM664JVzynNLFEtt2HPR_KT4V4iyyHBuU80Y0Q1z7vSwfNS8qFS6ReXgBAxOOAl1hpRVuJw7cqdToqVDAGOB9M3gdeBsDFg=s799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/75gzlG-vwsKwXUYHVLNcRgA7CQwGMwjlR0_Dt8uCUcVP8B7TqICnquoZG1-rh2j3vIfIPTy3nFG1aZ1DMV3usFCHTCRtPhWxAko0eOe5ejMRvhI-ZKG4M2wKJdeMt5d7oZHLLEoOQUwPjsTvbMGsN1dxcRtN1YJLtWAg6p_jHbqgjjOhDJ_XAJ-D2D1QvhEhu2K1l0cKeTKBvHBJ_N12FqBsw1QUFCYT5oSNPfAgaDIliAzVPxwMyl-14GfsSzHT3aeS7xeM4BgUoWUeScvezTINXVHP1r6Bf8IT5B59kF58Wax6Cd87STUObBBHlDcAkeHkoKWebhaI-VF34ZS838Nk7LxeF5ArsJHl6Z1FMTx2kjw-Mz2-k0kCcO9Pt7M5Wz2XuxMyONwAzxvOMUHphGOcXX8Ri5o25Cu71GZJoN1zD26XdqwoTyWog76aJnUb7qZWZ-hm1_AjT5HfheklLL7YHNA9XLMuC204qp_XhJuQ6NWTihH0ObYVUEFl2Q7C6f8IEwQWcuF9_gsc6zGJ_zyHhtcc98iz-Hz-Zjo8U78=w1217-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IEZYO5LIqnCaH8GQ-A_iaWjznfGWMNatJXpNvj9d3GWpVFVm28E0D1AmLS97RZF1v2cjjd5apqtvmlTYeFDpzfmvhITZJDAmsbsQQ2kpzbUqdSKeZmHGPK2a9jWUJf7uGsX7KIGtrBIWaJYUArkAuxrRFZzQDRGs5HLWOoG3UrdMO7Y4-y6CnLnbAiFd-OmyfApzDQyI8oQuPuKUvcBR46Uo1UW-YSuUuJ9TSFIl4PWxpykRo4y1HyVaW1ZxR4gxb6Ou65wH5tVjXULE1nYl5awyy1NwY8FatVBxYkjz-1Bu8KPrWf3DmwHgZVs0Wx7dC5SMlkYsmIKE3YWLJbfKN2lO4R2k0gQryFzwz7DI03CrPFSSU7935MrFsB2_unRHQEeUpC4voTyNTM0uAG9sGDqxpJC-Ii83IVpBEP-T4gA_rwYxJa24CqbtsTXQUhhClu_xRW2GDMj-mTXVc0bHRTDHtdwYBBWBn1KLaB2MLqNbQR569UN0sxyQHVbkv3VsF2AhDYzTsdjpwLTQsFBvRu7bPbYgZGQff_codbAWdlI=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xzf7V0zk078dXq-wvIS_jV3HsyVBdw5bjb4v5jn_yWMG3aRa3tp1rbqCIc1Tg-Tlw8W_7xK4oOPZbX1BTWEBHh-js11MFQ6gPopMLiouBhoki9gk07nzREjmv_YDm55ewdLCIfHJIFMU4i5-xibOT3SiDenCwSH_XeavVHKrlzac2cOoPpw1vzkZZbLM9p-Nlty_H43gvfaiYRPSXhAX9ljYfqwPLxKMleg7QomF2Xq1A-yQNdkSR5crGgjFNfD1KXaLg1Ufn7aA6gVjBgOP7Ryk57Vu1Yz5xP_Wx_3fPcW9zY-5BnKejl1nTYdxgOKhW9syWBj3K-pWxpwDoiaubpgjgBvLRujFGH_6X0EjFJA57grfJgczsSqs09RrjPNH9nLfacWTrdOcd4zMhJjDo_FK3EeJvhZENudXtqLcqWZF5ox2ukqZ4oKK5nSCkQ_zkBKWvo06U-tbSnycQBVNfsnyrMXYXVLUjwn9wH8e9LoaPJieJEkjpPl1SsKB7EXRYv2DLeD_CFS7QBQr3oCXLBERAYtVkzFiBvvEs1aPL9Q=w278-h156-no'),

It has a spectacular dark band of absorbing dust in front of the galaxy''s bright nucleus, giving rise to its nicknames of the "Black Eye" or "Evil Eye" galaxy. M64 is well known among amateur astronomers because of its appearance in small telescopes. It is a spiral galaxy in the Coma Berenices constellation.\r\n\r\n<p>The interstellar medium of Messier 64 comprises two counter-rotating disks which are approximately equal in mass. The inner disk contains the prominent dust lanes of the galaxy. The stellar population of the galaxy exhibits no measurable counter-rotation. Possible formation scenarios include a merger with a gas-rich satellite galaxy in a retrograde orbit, or the continued accretion of gas clouds from the intergalactic medium.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AKxOAzFmUdCbpGpYsJJJV5Pd--7leDpSA_Hy0SMf4PjemMuP2Htf-8zHiNY_gfrZhLojvA0S4kpNwFpz65V--c0wxMEoWHYsTjb1OGYl3xp4dqMkUulf9SP5ZRrZp_I60GcDmlADqkjkRwi8il71ZgMkFZoEAv2gYYyRIVUnqkWLDuZ_vhaFIgjTQxF23stBsibr3bkKsa2M8hJ-JfSY54hfvPczPUa_0Ipna-y3DkBn7yldu99BCk7Bm9xM3keUvvO75_zbqwZkVEQ9aMBBwNJPBVG_Ttsyo-ugMrxcfDZuShw6mjv_hCVGaNR-fHfHFhiZ9pZCjM46-3N_GP_j-i_Yi7MqEeVoB0syg_HFS5evo5yCVloqXyLU2OGerCGAAEaztGVKmlx-7RprS9akX8IDdSOVyWbcxcuWqMCzpaF4YeOSOLfRfPcuvaKMcWlt9ETTbsY3TmhvEE4ni_-U8A_OqK-QFfw4u1XfaWLF_bbW3MQ8_9jUGTw20yrylrGrsorvbZXGElhgBz6xms3inpfg8Wzg-WMcbILVlUPEjiM=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ebBj6Dl6rfeZ450jJWbr7wZjZeB5I36UHtk4LKU_lwI2p2U5rEHl4-qdcLZnlnqcYXLVSfyk2_9Cx3oeF9AhVGStA0XZouuEysFnEmT3ew3Dsp17oicYpEpm08PjbzdGdZy7sELpgnSlBZPMj2ux8_350r0O1DOgUpsHoXnbv49lLR7MK4eMGLm9buo1rVTfqgG1NIiNoc_4V6qXxwMocW4RitE1-cMrumrenEIEd-K28KR7j9SmksT116KUfmH2MSFRhAClaYJMHDuwmMXgLKGmpiGVkl2X7kCSXlW1dW6656nPQXiCRLvIIDQxTwltafDaDJz15tnlH9AvHBal_QbspkQ-piWkx1_a-qYYrNecKsqHeLQxLMoTXP4X4u-y6PDNp-hSljPmkkdtiIHr9AYT_U0LYqHCJ09AtPG1ERzDcSkTZDqcNRLqJpbBmFvpE8ZrOzaoKTZlWh2OblS2UTKzERFcnRySvdJ3SFPK5gMdKPejMA9_4URIxFeUEA-2WVKX-rgn2GmsFsMRFAwzzj0MNPKi6KvQYZabladXCTE=w673-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AlSHS8mpVoEsQysq0RHlClB_J2VJWyJ255ETsW1xL6Q9VZamsyJpyzr9CwCDbED86luD_068-3QB7z8Yiy9d3VDZZOQPNKuVhj9cywkyM_OTnkyKbBVHJSzvEBvOQfluP_Uh4dy6xpDU1JWWIWwbWMGxk2TDvNa8lpebGBV_7dXmdN2XSXMCp6QnSXkOyHHw7JzOiCA24WC0B75Vn0FBLyi88uf--2Ezrm0PC3t5-ZTlmRntNhTpmeNCAMUa-fZBH5bonpiL9WyEppqZz74w2SESWvYTybvGprhkpdmjVP-Z5QwvfnR1jdd6zKDZBlAb-BxKkptb72HquwOWhIZJqDfSY4bOC8bqqwgg1Z6X4g64akb4oqflVDiVMbsW9PRQbs0T7Cv-HQZo90UgARQm-pr4PHqfRk0vujGpQTWAbDcGcocZ-dsIjbyl4K621fjepSfB0wSKzOiBOtOHw9lPH6EJ_BSrEWQk58qPKBuKaeul5vY7upycKGf2wWkGg7GPPHa2j7ER6j5sWk_gTcD_yQi2cDB9uZ--Jg7uauKHakI=s799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gxiIxTQBroWdWFZ7naEh5IrvtiG6B6VIhVqyqcaAxw0hie0tyfhn2IrSPnVxZrWrbPvGyXKiGbWjScFtHEChHizO86YNwQdA-l3nhAiP7OthGJuGUxxGlzdv6YkRZlMTV7aR2ldmGrndoj5LDpqjiODJpg2l5ESKiqAX-pS6JmjyIjZImebTFFG17cRsUa88q89fsR_RV2Xfa92EZ7QQte5HMcW6sH9eq1RnnDA8POTlfyIjROuPH7bgwdHnjiisd1cXpCFJQW3uDP-zlpEwn6pfWPanIKwbNpS6B-wNHfYwVNUFJQwhZ3aeoDKjOj0VmTdbkX9hRhslZMe8qcg38zZYBzgXKJXFF4tW_WW0csM7iDJRCHaCgybi-sy21NH2mz7rILWWRaN3CA_V8Z95n7WkPaOQlAIc7sIBj8LEOrROrIH3QC4CdrtdwZL6pdBEns7VNNOs5sOpKaCP7PigWIdmQK7nkuG3QggSnp3FRuT_iExomVd9zHhjsxcmAWgBHYHMTYTRuHY2K3DL4LemAFw-BzeR4kFd-2o1H-WxZF4=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/taTy8vjcnS1a34eaNJVLBNxW1zJb3JB7qlCxUZy5wbyaNL_MDVA693Q6-Qy3deRKehG2O-p_LysnXiMFuq_OrKlBldgAxTbC0xkCjlW1rQL-zs8na3AKmt6nzGs3y8y8LCOC9OBboWOV8gtUBKkrFWy1RcFi4aHR1Z5XeHdIWpr3lEeH4SrQ4UZr0XG_0TDre0vMd3upGdZBZTJK_bSDgPelnxL8ELrNz8IHEMXrrCFeFqKX3aU-Z0-_PWrOOM-K9KxCsdU0SrUnRLC7O8yC6Jska8NHipCCYRpLWN2zU4HE6zkw8cJZVRumgGrg6mfzabTalraoRs4AaHhHYPxzFzW4UB2U8dyiobSxN72Hb2JI_d1chiaDwxwUV1euj9HM1ve8Qlo0YiDK23Ke6Ftx_F6d7p1_70EBaSvxe70v8SgL1bHl14QruBqC4MeLibz9UNd1BuVNHtV5x-TI0AHngOT0dBxX1fzfikS-dinzos2oh-BxKluSF6cTqmRbYpvxCAQXu7uJZXPB5364qFu_Cq0c7jo3YR_NY5tO10yOhB8=w278-h156-no'),
(3, 'Messier 81', 11.8, 'spiral galaxy', 'Messier 81 (also known as NGC 3031 or Bode''s Galaxy) is a spiral galaxy about 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. Due to its proximity to Earth, large size and active galactic nucleus (which harbors a 70 million M<sub>☉</sub> supermassive black hole), Messier 81 has been studied extensively by professional astronomers. The galaxy''s large size and relatively high brightness also make it a popular target for amateur astronomers.\r\n\r\n<p>Messier 81 was first discovered by Johann Elert Bode in 1774. Consequently, the galaxy is sometimes referred to as "Bode''s Galaxy". In 1779, Pierre Méchain and Charles Messier reidentified Bode''s object, which was subsequently listed in the Messier Catalogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the emission at infrared wavelengths originates from interstellar dust. This interstellar dust is found primarily within the galaxy''s spiral arms, and it has been shown to be associated with star formation regions. The general explanation is that the hot, short-lived blue stars that are found within star formation regions are very effective at heating the dust and hence enhancing the infrared dust emission from these regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only one supernova has been detected in Messier 81. The supernova, named SN 1993J, was discovered on 28 March 1993 by F. Garcia in Spain. At the time, it was the second brightest supernova observed in the 20th century. The spectral characteristics of the supernova changed over time. Initially, it looked more like a type II supernova (a supernova formed by the explosion of a giant star) with strong hydrogen spectral line emission, but later the hydrogen lines faded and strong helium spectral lines appeared, making the supernova look more like a type Ib. Moreover, the variations in SN 1993J''s luminosity over time were not like the variations observed in other type II supernovae but did resemble the variations observed in type Ib supernovae. Hence, the supernova has been classified as a type IIb, a transitory class between type II and type Ib. The scientific results from this supernova suggested that type Ib and Ic supernovae were actually formed through the explosions of giant stars through processes similar to those taking place in type II supernovae. The supernova was also used to estimate a distance of 8.5 ± 1.3 Mly (2.6 ± 0.4 Mpc) to Messier 81. As a local galaxy, the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT) tracks novae in M81 along with M31 and M33.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jc_1yHENci1V67Di_DWBaf7VQClVvMhnGCG0ThDM5-mgjIevkWHOmnbSSssvRbC2B3ywQCsEjYTUfUSsOZ8RPKY5DheMrOv-jvZryPAjdlob3uMlmepp_hsBP5aXDjwWKTDDqsKpAOHitlqcU0fNuR4gFijlbrlIEW4gJA0U4EEvswCE7vaUZ9fR2va7ULXVjivedQpgHSR5aNoJEMvJ8Qp82rdL5rKoWS6LDAXLnd0_mPJw2_hsRQf-YQvmjXYb053Kt_mfDugTgVZJ2Yr1aUAZ33T73IqfUZ2QfPDNuHH02WpjobLhjEaJ2nlLHFa_vQX6BgMx_EXhgFj6HtfamqlRwO84H_KfIu0jALNOYukT3eIxFDCJ_vVepDibXCwula9DZvYThH93uOU2MwFvW2rzyw2cS3H3dpbQiSQU7zqOYFb2zJ5126pWUfpp9Ww1RAuUxKTb1fZmcMVLGhNslklHwEd6YIUxT40Cy-MiFvOb2hqsktv0V4B9Iu_xZbpOS_V8DJBgP4AUbKBnwV9PJGIxJLyTSinoXqNwmtW90CU=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1cLk6Jv1NRULomJbwEUBAyxQ1Yon_CT6fBz-Om25bTbqmX-C_slj5-qGQ1wc4Lf58gky_0uK3nzw2dmHFkLqOzIl2U6dOMYhr9eUhFbATZzl-VznrvWG2ITZA2Q8hZSeAAcNqOKVoRAZuoq6zOdo5MgMTe0fR0aG8S_DMajNeX7NlTUAcGSu9rEnF0Y7y3J0_anCCEzo-4E2dqQGZ88cCvzKnrqVdaId-Vn2TO1B2wXzHejb5sIwj4HG98_iC-Cy68LOHENL3pKb6bdxbDGGsm7aKY7CIKU4Pj-eqRpeepNujsEiBiB_upET9m6-jtVG0sjjZMvlo0wxNQoUt7J4L5GN3I1w3AJHope3cjSXcJke1BvRn7Qz15o7YUMVRcRSWxD2wo_n7XPH2GBL4P8x3dwV6eucw-jNQ3R074wcYdXhuCrjZH3t4Pr4boejxM27HCLsYVozj78Y739uCwGEr11rYyz-0LIyciNcKAVwJdu8aio7CjrOAdgKgkV4K-k6XcKi4ptmW_u8Y_ILmNwpKfRyrKAxNa0lpM7BfYKhR2A=w609-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uMCH2G9qcZJEBftz9D2YFBvCrTSbLeyb-nBCsfVaAqksVnSbqCSFed29l1aPUns-gix6FYIGIfGSUTkGTgaLstZ1IZoIHuGTJJ1XHt9j_J_pb5yBVdQeYWxRu0VioEdk3fYB5oLwXbZX4S4EbAycB1FFvZGivlgJF75Sxcj0suc_FdFDXRbmfPuAFSJaNj8vTmzWi85he3KWrRx38oUBanflaYvs_Jf1sF9dM4QP5UJ_Jw9ADTtWS8qiBChVjJJZCi70VCLAnNHiJ9kTmiKTFOqeJxCPxTdHlLw7gIo3GnGeZ7TpaD2xsztzoAdeRLFILK_OoNFZATp1MQO09Ruee_SWjQeG1O36_nh9r70AYTHtLw42bmWpRZEv6oMseOfXVSM_gBWdIeoxPAkfcHyDw0GJYd5aXL1xpAYj0kYpxZjjEbCniFSZrMEgxGpbBeat2c86vb7_RQdW7l3Epd48-1mWSFTzYsp2xnUXeAs4pCn5MKBXwsTID-uq2u_xS8A_AnlKiefAV20dsAyCnaZM5IuC3Qi6urjxHrURPQ3TXA=w801-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WzUJtNNV3FW_3LnNCcKC_U9j6fg0kTIhxMvBLUk2y8Y1CrGdr2BeA2ZnJBADSZRSt8zN9YrsJrHRQ3tQBulyGM9VvA2u1ipyo0pu9yY3MNsmAW-nq4fd8VRtuS0tAOPW_k-WpgxIG8c99Cy_o53ykeCJg3SE5L5rPPq_tDsmVZqEmgsXayB5HHHxQAUpKbr9zFaFeCCXHvqAENZJPBrfA9cqWVc1J9GYSeSSVgrxbjwhpHkzJuq90csuIK6RaGx3wJ7ryUjd5-0G1UyPz7InHsZH_Oe3Y04IQZDh88IzkH5WIUqzMF_KiamrFCU15SNaTCeLZspgsRT5cFoyn2Mqhlaql_CHgyXFSMpDPzZ6iRGQ9GXDflx191ndRARSRHiM2TezgAo7v0iNVT8mP2FwmYuVspTWof-CYlqpeStWwGnk_8lt8ywnOvCY_doc9S0H8M8kR0Z-GrSqdbFT5ho383o0KqIJzx59HMH45Zg_Z_O3E0X3M0fAm8ZWue8tkyR3ZfetEtWfxUedj82Gf9QGJoPqJnd3AZKA5j0acrPmqj8=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iLHtkRiPc2DIRUVHdmvtCXGhqpOLDBem3Fqa7eYX8m-1MaWHKC1GQ277dZKtcZMBmyMmjm25ASrfnSrvkXWw9p4X8j5ksshZcpCeoEboiBbwy5iHWcl6BEFILPWmct2tQmJNqBcgNVqjx5TvZBi-8Qzt8Ot2wOWaqBivBFBDNB0172c6FBzwXQ0FLlWR7Ifxr4OpcjSyV9giKJJHvtWp1BSW0SBxn8H2q9JV88mLFG-QoJxCoCcLPkSqNk7GagXvG0RCuEVhIDovkPPeeDWtASxA5OvKG9vpmsUANO17cOa9zglL1QAC3Ef_DoDt9r_l8Nq5LQckfFsNa6b2ZITlHIaMXrvM9sclRq2MusdhQgcibsuWe98ZinTGIdBaphldr9HAY96_Kk4gbojZ9L75AJQAgpTYr5eFf8AS4XVo8WScKoShnrxqhFleVOCR8ps9TXWf_zhlirrmjEE3IrhsIs1Ed_BeRhmr-PvAf_lF5mv554vujnrBsFLjrCzwbNeKdW-ctBy8N6PIF1kkTT8sJ_jWXDopCCBYCoEvxNMsVAs=w278-h156-no'),
(4, 'Cartwheel Galaxy', 500, 'lenticular, ring galaxy', 'The Cartwheel Galaxy (also known as ESO 350-40) is a lenticular galaxy and ring galaxy about 500 million light-years away in the constellation Sculptor. It is an estimated 150,000 light-years across, has a mass of about 2.9–4.8 × 10<sup>9</sup> solar masses, and rotates at 217 km/s.\r\n\r\n<p>It was discovered by Fritz Zwicky in 1941. Zwicky considered his discovery to be "one of the most complicated structures awaiting its explanation on the basis of stellar dynamics."</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An estimation of the galaxy''s span resulted in a conclusion of 150,000 light years, which is slightly larger than the Milky Way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cartwheel galaxy shows non-thermal radio and optical spokes, but they are not the same spokes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The galaxy was once a normal spiral galaxy before it apparently underwent a head-on collision with a smaller companion approximately 200 million years ago (i.e., 200 million years prior to the image). When the nearby galaxy passed through the Cartwheel Galaxy, the force of the collision caused a powerful shock wave through the galaxy, like a rock being tossed into a sandbed. Moving at high speed, the shock wave swept up gas and dust, creating a starburst around the galaxy''s center portion that were unscathed. This explains the bluish ring around the center, brighter portion.[9] It can be seen that the galaxy is beginning to retake the form of a normal spiral galaxy, with arms spreading out from a central core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, a model based on the gravitational Jeans instability of both axisymmetric (radial) and nonaxisymmetric (spiral) small-amplitude gravity perturbations allows an association between growing clumps of matter and the gravitationally unstable axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric waves which take on the appearance of a ring and spokes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The unusual shape of the Cartwheel Galaxy may be due to a collision with a smaller galaxy such as those in the lower left of the image. The most recent star burst (star formation due to compression waves) has lit up the Cartwheel rim, which has a diameter larger than the Milky Way. Star formation via starburst galaxies, such as the Cartwheel Galaxy, results in the formation of large and extremely luminous stars. When massive stars explode as supernovas, they leave behind neutron stars and black holes. Some of these neutron stars and black holes have nearby companion stars, and become powerful sources of X-rays as they pull matter off their companions (also known as ultra and hyperluminous X-ray sources). The brightest X-ray sources are likely black holes with companion stars, and appear as the white dots that lie along the rim of the X-ray image. The Cartwheel contains an exceptionally large number of these black hole binary X-ray sources, because many massive stars formed in the ring.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vn3nkqpf5wGnX_7VqzyEKJN91UIvXp3yDF6DnDqQdi10BB7nTTmW3zdWHFk6IvF7eZQP2nkd9m6C2l15TX8Vct2XZCI9vEqglP8uqWgaoyPP0xtqd9me-FEFeWU7EK0O2bcjWraHgL5yPUupL2G4x0JhrCeKpt-fFTEAllZoHdS6Mm0X8dm4uD_SoHWs5biDSLZyxjQEITPtuQbwp1R8uchU9GiVEpIq7cS6tJUwxXFzWfzlG68xVyiZyyMcL1iCzo3iU8kw4PAKgMZs4UyungFSikWsQNPMiHkUnDvPOc3mXP4X3ORuqTD0yECZ6Q0opYmlkIBS0-qLfxJRDgBNWL8a7Ht5bUCsrYovAfvPOqzTfvVY_A_27i7SyORWsNBJCDcnhGkX6y1ACXXW1ppcjBRDxmYl0DGYDH5Jjqe-QaPsVE7QepbMQNu1X3O-K-POPEuX0A5u_FWTnX8wTdo-dmmdEsr6ASWfSdVEMn_B0JEBJgaQ1X6JggyFLCSQdetFEfabdoTQ8pzbfAr2ixxroKFBBdjl1L7f5S2pMN1mMac=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Vhvsct2pVAO_UqUE6pVeypRp50OMfTm2XrB90hcvDihLqPhKmA6sUC-5Ag4ahwcJLX9cG1I6_62DR99Rd-pdlM27DxrFqeIUQYhNp9lOhmlDEPa6wpN_P0OG_gNdN6gy3zjlvtckY4x5OP_riIPmNOoUrObzePWW767hTHNmFgNwPlFjKYqaoMi7U1lYtC4kgx-pfFtLjMNJ2vr99dI_9OuhSdjSnsq-dA94XnG3Vrt3kTZ2k8paXTIRWKqpEO6dDInSOgjBC3eAEP-lhuwLdS47kZTQp7xc2Iviz44JOr4tuMjpiqntBpZwm6LKXDm2hpgdRp9Pu2pYXJ_ACKsDvnsf8Xx-xy9uzdf8FC3V7YE_cIRBqTiJwLdGN1NhLCz41K7UntymIbFxI9mfQWxCTfFM53BDf4yQcnX0P_TfGnkogGAIPrppbq57md3yChsLTRmPTOCeK4FGroH-iAubIfCzzWuiN4P0JPEtnksKZt9BFRJLuWr2SNNKjBEWIT_aDZHnY7U4jA-9rA4DpoQ9_P_7-nMItZEwvVCie9f6enA=w750-h502-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vqx7KGqsPOq2KHsc1A0FA_cl6qoCasG92t4t1VifWcL5LgEXjfWSUqw8RwMTeCL8LvM-UH-UP1-W6yCJCYlIANpanjzfPv2gSXYLCzmcretSg0OUUVKxOflQjcZe-nQpM-NJl1nEIUVby0W85G9kaY15nukYnBl9uTUTuM5l_uIO2vdMNiXHimKnx0qi9L-euYx1_LNDX7SwVsDbtOuH-1RiuYyygLP2l2olOHTyleCojH9wLj90jdOYhAJpirkfP9cTURXQkPpWaeR8TTFqMNQG6EHyi5UWzLeFkAVjIs6j8RpBIOn5qQRtgw81yT9nzr5brVRbkvM1aWTLcxLiS2myLLR4tR4RnYQXKZ-4vTQtBXYPzgklwChdWbzI6pd_c2t63LnCiJTsJYXqlbVh7nF9RThbiQFjbY-B7rCUeElEcZqkbNE5vBZPrW35LX_Q0CuQ-HRlTpTJfxdnqjaHnEecmMjyFuUQEY2raxaz-anCzJH78EvwWwM06E1FKrik2piWZCdASro7n30y906cb7xs2tq8MUxGGt1zZ4VUVkI=w1043-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YyWzHrkZm0JNzezBrP97wSG2xJA-LTWp3zKuOu-pia0rks2ayswd1F4aa62eDKc5kvzxgzFjX13W0R-BtaOSTED0RfsMUqyy70gIJl-YZONdrGlO5b-yobxg9Neb99xowDMKN3X6Avj0pVy1hzywu1EhXPUgUVTAgQKBmKOcTPSQK5EdvKsD06BP0uAzTAvkDhXF6_OQDSXG_PUZSat4O-vTjwJd94FKW6AQ8I_IEZuTcv-Xyy0HrGauJRW7fSR9DuQT8ZrG3EtvVuWGZBRF8ZNDx6VmwD4SmESa4nXvj2OEa6N8Qq8oif8OTM69XvAFuvRZCc4ttaLZ50R0W8WXNth79SMZC68m8PfN7Qj1ExPC-B8t726lR3SLdAcPZ5uoZggIZ7D9Zw86IASuREVcc_J-qZcoYXwvc9jLve2Gv46ZBibW8tekSxb4NwYY_d5Dw6afqz5fKsJhfs-AX4kSSS2zaK1liuBbYDO7QdBydrY0C1P6l11iG34Frs8Thsqm2lIEFV-BcCVoaieNeL9uv_dtQ9LHDJIZnssvlMMsVYE=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ax3LlUSkswn0h1JhugHWQ4zWLgQ3b3hadF4_Jjad3VM7rtT_x5Ouxf0Pq34YGXtKWa1S8MeFVK4-s-vPOVe-assyhAsRJ7PZ7FbECLUOZVgVqr7BWDZ-PBqYBwwdOt9R_Ub4UC7Zw1Ww2hTo6Oct9giW9XyHU0_eG4u_kOCmHGehd7_kfvpLm50_dStSHUmWOcJqq9rEWtpwlchBrJgnomTjw-XhDc2IOVedcC6M10Jnn2t2DedYs3qKPgoDwqnO7rp0dM8wAKVwwpGslTdFlnmCOtUrpWSe7Db7JaA8kaZK2c26UV75naFiEnIsVtnxTuRqaOwpldyU9Mi4gUYxb1LM5tCMq6L9jbigiKwpi4OcIleByMLJN8R6uNZfeAOKYXzP9MZgZ6lRLvf5-9P3ei_weXsS1f5h1M3p0SSs6IHZEo49H76iohPfbFQwKP4WMQ4_JuiBGdLi_q9sFfvyqXD2B64T69IBzmy8uucx_WP9ZjWOubgYYt7FZ8rlsks8c6GdLIhg5Tl-_pygf5wrWa-HcZRusncgZ8O7vqCBwM0=w278-h156-no'),
(5, 'Cigar Galaxy', 11.4, 'starburst galaxy', 'Messier 82 (also known as NGC 3034, Cigar Galaxy or M82) is a starburst galaxy about 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. It is about five times more luminous than the whole Milky Way and one hundred times more luminous than our galaxy''s center. The starburst activity is thought to be triggered by interaction with neighboring galaxy M81, and M82 is a member of the M81 Group. As the closest starburst galaxy to our own, M82 is the prototypical example of this type of galaxy. SN 2014J, a Type Ia supernova, was observed in the galaxy on 21 January 2014, see 2014 supernova. In 2014, in studying M82, scientists discovered the brightest pulsar yet known, designated M82 X-2.\r\n\r\n<p>M82 was previously believed to be an irregular galaxy. In 2005, however, two symmetric spiral arms were discovered in near-infrared (NIR) images of M82. The arms were detected by subtracting an axisymmetric exponential disk from the NIR images. Even though the arms were detected in NIR images, they are bluer than the disk. The arms were previously missed due to M82''s high disk surface brightness, our nearly edge-on view of this galaxy (~80°), and confusion by a complex network of dusty filaments in its optical images. These arms emanate from the ends of the NIR bar and can be followed for the length of 3 disc scales. Assuming that the northern part of M82 is nearer to us, as most of the literature does, the observed sense of rotation implies trailing arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 2010, radio astronomers working at the Jodrell Bank Observatory of the University of Manchester reported an unknown object in M82. The object started sending out radio waves, and the emission did not look like anything seen anywhere in the universe before. There have been several theories about the nature of this unknown object, but currently no theory entirely fits the observed data. It has been suggested that the object could be an unusual "micro quasar", having very high radio luminosity yet low X-ray luminosity, and being fairly stable, it could be an analogue of the low X-ray luminosity galactic microquasar SS 433. However, all known microquasars produce large quantities of X-rays, whereas the object''s X-ray flux is below the measurement threshold. The object is located at several arcseconds from the center of M82 which makes it unlikely to be associated with a supermassive black hole. It has an apparent superluminal motion of four times the speed of light relative to the galaxy center. Apparent superluminal motion is consistent with relativistic jets in massive black holes and does not indicate that the source itself is moving above lightspeed.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fZgxzF0LUJZLr6DMVS8Oe-0rGW6HBrhTB7w_EDgIARXihQaNFt0NVqneL2-GiNPaheb9cvorMDpR3invN0ivBR7VxFT3FNZaBB_m-ScaqkmmQsLfN8RKNhx3HNGpcynkLeL6_CGi1RHfPP-5bPf7sAWg7Wcbd32kszcm7F_lcL0RJJSngsk8Op6JigCVdVtt1HUB3S-Kqf0s1lblgS6t-VaOXG9jhM0Ryt0A6jG_18CZRWCNW5Mfl9VrAdYLIIDN-jZs1CJlf2SVxCK-88rF9CF5yqRUZeYOL2nyyLcHinjtIfoGEBYoCgnPSiN9iPbpfQKpYSS4DvekrXQsMEXJK_jskKr1dmWPAZNUUzaateDJ-VRHrr4k5fW-aRvc8TksaCJXigRecOFs42IRW6qOTRdaiVoZTA3RlDQ5FVKkY5fU_OKXhb1-jMuonDtjHJx7Ozzt2__TSQR57Mji11Xa2EGGzkOYua1shXEF8fMDtpAf9TPzIqEGSa7KTMjNsSdlJ8ihbO5CI58Ht0XFXgTJFBysMvMnWNJN7Yfr50Kvx3U=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IngKSqmUUeIm1g2CZ8UcNFBWl9WuhkYCUCqckwY0IO4u8bfICtSqmY60KYTgassSB5-xepEq2w3-c75XSV8dKp2Hsja9gUn50dkjgn_oSaSwO-j2SVLKVjDiHW9pWSxL_9MdbR3xTjw4t6NgQ_NNADcMiFd__HjHYnzokrhYo7CMZK2i-GkXdMgu_0GOrdc6sGoJysH408SqNviZQ6CN6ouOka1zsdV8ncnX4Zlu6eIVYpEua-Qv7jGA-MEV6iOD27AULVH-VV6ZIrzoRJ_f9WjHeUwYHitbXG-_DC1isQq51gK65o7E6m5QpfRK6LAwWizbBzdvHy_SrlehM8UJSP40iyHjot7cMtyygzNpNFZRNmw_zUOM7q1S4rNo3MNlQCUQOsnBn6hbAv66E2q8_a8AUmYQsiilTKopLoK0wJ85JY7TmQTZ_D8h6uF3UR4CgT_8WidYkkCOPkkbJiHGGhvYdF7qZzHXf0nG4wtsct2jO-TRDQUZ7aOuw_iNLhblNRJUrVOFtJeglXciyPjF3GgfGakbtgxVBygPWuQpk-c=w949-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6AUOelyvMAljyGRIDaMDA7WhPckTKB9VHPHLOn1kk9x0thM251w5JseEZp4QPZIjFi489BoSBF7EesOwAYvcWb8KHpun6K-oeTf5FZLTrwTpxMh9N6Z1zt98vjpjcWzo_gbqNqARr8VEAmhQvuk0D-RT1jWSvFZqFmejRg9-4F-L0EZjuaNaV-luUy-vWnZx3ikhpPASj3hLF7DxHhC_eivyn1b1bm-VZcYiuTW91ATwoIRBLv3xZwQjcL0-NeJiLurQ3fSD3RIztEGvVm3bp9Krvrv5pQc9W60WWJi7WSb8xXH68WiW2bT9YlxanGq5Rj_nnVrlTvclZhkFvc0Oqijuy_Jb14hxyz-0kZnU9uj9U3ytKvodLK3d835_D-FE89tcx2jhpVwky_r8yQErO3XijmJqlm9dFbpBX4p7K_FJ6pXIs1LKEFZIsb1dXZ6MRXdMfTK9S5SE_6bONtPAvacEafDhFonNbzd0ZdkBT9azeYRO9KFn3vCBzftV03_5gRApxWo_dO-LEOIpRPiUVFh2_MSan2n2r1b98OKEbfQ=w1026-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cutMyVsEIz_R0B8fA_95o1-buLmBuBXgsuBPkxOChODUOs-K3vqsvYbtcuZqLnFVlTr9PlDohlKz5g5T47MaB3l-MA2Z2tRbPs6lJCwH8Z2YYppCj7teNDAHADrD5-7jx0AcpWquUeu28AiE91qGuB6HqO41mx7IXS5uM71bhsH9a0tIcjn7U27k2inmYEjPEKotJuWGo5SAGxANMZLZgo8VwDjnbv2FqpXyhRm_PxJ5RdN1ksEeuO6KTEW1U115d7hyPTT39od1hN631aEx8tvYuMkKN0DICxyIv6HEco3IUb2NOp0cHcGRjn_vSwRMtiUMoe5DRLay0AEboz6OiwrOqnRn0nMNqascM2x1rni6j-u2pP8ceIWEGdSmo3lDJ_PZDgrKaUN9rovUh4FzQkliPofzUoStliE2upnYWl-18-39XZLesTzK48xkM3OEncoORlt7JOYzpYoadGtNy1QqZDS2vaFncpqWql7W0jdREnwDUAKcfVB2lPTCeHHJ8K4C6Xkq9WUSlpiP19DBWa7vDN3Q_iCHJ0rnV0rrBBg=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xkuXuJDhhEk-MHS295SUwqxmFLjHf1cXICgD-4htgg41NHim-NsJxicdQwPeCJN--wJ_X2j4GaF7WMHIKE0KYFst1D6BFxNEI4AXSrZGW7MCtAQU8d5b3mvUbge6dERPLkAcbtH36S9nC37p-G6-szhf5igXZupNOIPM0QoHel9Y_0vCAioLFxf0vX2JaCFVMEuHFuajmQ9YFlJZP8ogtYoTXgfCY4l8gw6HLE9J0Is1F9dG3dLlPv8xdMFL-SsO2ZQQq94S_9iRfQ4J9VcMDR-iYyE9GZ0tP3wtEz1i12eU1KdQui2YlhOUV_aVx9CgHbMTnpbYtZiJ50g4EOtSb_JGwL5DMudtUNOSTEcFu2yjIY5eTp1QoAmtpjKrMPGJ4z1kIsQ5OTw7-bYx2XK4y0fgN8nTqy2hExKOdrelD43JBw5mOb4mxULwkCCssTBspngqjQ3Y6EL_ZjRDUCNUP1NxGrqn9bVLPv8DYGe81RFJG0uT_XdT_xFQuwl41uXYIauKcShjQyylQ9_x8hxmkIFuGXIGtmLTBfr2D00Og3k=w278-h156-no'),
(6, 'Comet Galaxy', 3200, 'spiral galaxy', 'The Comet Galaxy is a spiral galaxy located 3.2 billion light-years from Earth, in the galaxy cluster Abell 2667, was found with the Hubble Space Telescope. This galaxy has a little more mass than our Milky Way. It was detected on 2 March 2007.\r\n\r\n<p>The unique galaxy, which is situated 3.2 billion light-years from the Earth, has an extended stream of bright blue knots and diffuse wisps of young stars. This spiral galaxy rushes with 3.5 million km/h through the cluster Abell 2667 and thereby like a comet shows a tail with a length of 600,000 light-years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comet galaxy is currently being ripped to pieces. Moving through a cluster at speeds of greater than 2 million mph, is one of the main reasons the gas and stars of the galaxy are being stripped away by the tidal forces of the cluster. Other factors adding to the damage of the galaxy are the cluster''s scorching gas plasma. As the galaxy speeds through, its gas and stars are still being stripped away by the tidal forces exerted by the cluster - just as the tidal forces exerted by the moon and Sun push and pull the Earth''s oceans. Also contributing to this destructive process is the pressure of the cluster''s hot gas plasma reaching temperatures as high as 10-100 million degrees. Scientists estimate that the total duration of the transformation process is close to one billion years. What is seen now in the Hubble''s image is roughly 200 million years into the process. Even though the Comet Galaxy’s mass is slightly greater than the Milky Way, it will lose all its gas and dust, and so not be able to generate stars later in life. It will become a gas-poor galaxy with an old population of red stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the ram pressure stripping process, the charged particles strip and push away the infalling galaxy’s gas, just as the solar wind of charged particles pushes ionized gas away from a comet to create a gas tail. For this reason the scientists have nicknamed the stretched spiral the "comet galaxy."</p>\r\n\r\n<p>"This unique galaxy, situated 3.2 billion light-years from Earth, has an extended stream of bright blue knots and diffuse wisps of young stars driven away by the tidal forces and the ram pressure stripping'' of the hot dense gas," said Jean-Paul Kneib, a study collaborator from the Laboratoire d''Astrophysique de Marseille.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though its mass is slightly larger than that of the Milky Way, the spiral will inevitably lose all its gas and dust as well as its chance of generating new stars later, and become a gas-poor galaxy with an old population of red stars. The finding sheds light on the process by which gas-rich galaxies might evolve into gas-poor galaxies over billions of years. The new observations also reveal one mechanism for forming of “homeless” stars seen scattered throughout galaxy clusters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strong gravitational pull exerted by the galaxy cluster''s collective mass has bent the light of other, more distant galaxies and distorted their shapes - an effect called gravitational lensing. The giant bright banana-shaped arc seen just to the left of the cluster centre corresponds to the magnified and distorted image of a distant galaxy located behind the cluster''s core.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wAhEstUjSmTkHqDiiyxpCkuTtC3LYiOG5UvdtFXxONQua7ipiE2dZHvs5YIlQ3r_CesK4cdqkkMZ_RMaz6VuUntSghjYDomdqWxpUeyZj06X8fi2M63z9ZD23kIvyONLtCCcKry-8bwA-Hj6j9X1PXsys7NOM96dognJeuFHV0CEENmUc5SjhwG9BC3SQK5kyxDSEfe4b9A-9rOp81vQcGEo0bk7J2JftRJa-GhhZw2F_FYJ3ooZnZa1odtjtNZhTzMk2uGPEJ8bKrdY8Y7un_d3TTxV7CRzNxipRSHfk9lPKqujRp9TvKX9WkH2XdLsFeA3QmTXjDQaLl2mvtVn0-ygE7rqxKCUf4m_yYxcn6cyda0G5fYHc4IaDqY5AqcXyHa_IkwMI6axVsMsY-O7C-OX-dQ7dOIqSdAEMIJTo2EesPclP5sojjywFukLFake2_G5oJdeVwVTvYrrn5gCX2Zr3fJLAeuYf_1Mc5ITkRilvPB9-bjS1zmCWGMso2nsT7B_axrwISQUo_DutgLGnHdw3omv0QM_fXLeIPZ228s=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i3-fyNn5flP_QVyFT0fg5LCRPE_zlfs-YoT4ewyicTr4QX1sq2QUux4SWiaW78pEGWcOSp1JPl9RMvbkuEGf0N36Q3YXxg4uv7LUXSYDpu650XGIRzOYd_scckewwUG89TkUPdctQfyVk44c-WvNn3N4susr4eFkfbojej0Rg_MZWmGnVqixSCatFSBEOkFm2aWbPuj2qrXbsSUf71MZtXuWTCaQwpcE4NjvVwNhPttNASrZTOrC5Ea2hmQeOEqUHzK_YRJxl3moRN4n2P7fNuDTlB9PYvDiAepPMD29UZDtZ2Y83Kv-oxxgRrwH5xp2LZAeu_S2tZOBBEZBKQ7B8MlBLDFcnMM-f71KvxFxumij7DMRM0F0wPi1ogDCZZTn987fZapUqHh-EGzpGsmzbFa-fgMSwXBn6aVxwSm7SQiVRoRTy8i39dDc72d1EkApiMtGtRMZllrb-7CJ5o5uh-3vE8_mIFwEADXj5DQVCOBA3iv4NfjCJXf-VBqiVuWz0zxrQrgAarHkuINd5pRLbKQnGC8EUciUQRz7oijoYGk=w808-h608-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XYLLQwI6Oy3tljxKNyCB-X8R1sMiRE3Z3SiqAZXqDhwPT3nPq5zgKWtKliWJQ7EOfh5zUh0zo1Tl8ph5DJUztUraeODt9x607fsZZ9Jq4OF05TSC9Fcyk33Sw1JeGvYSibwzWtGJcKnQv_3pABXaGdrySxFwqKShtK3XmCdnk9NUxewkfi1htMd_-fEj0iLcvYOnQ87H4RwcVUDLbDjOTp03iE0Zw4a7zHmN4CvwdehCy6PabwBYJUiMNLSpSb-uNYeVZmOtC_jMDKW7f4oNpOl4Pq0p4QVCH6ZY38Lg2p4ECsknIHqpQkjR1PXaOrzYKXKdisQ83dvnW301C2Ti_TBC7CJwPSFRdPb0YsJ1-gviygQZE4ruZE-nWyocf3z7psa3FzvIpv7QZ0WgFMlBYxG_65eugYjgSPkzoi9Wr1sdOuFME_uVOi6ihWVX7udnZQCkRCf6SZRSSLWFoEcknL3DLNpqUUnPopX4SfFh1jbtfEDwtGzexFTAKCwShhr9nC0c4zKqupaNUdS38qPLaEQwDPGLkFQYd8ZsdzJYuTM=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2zVydlVov_lCVyvuweBn0iLVe4W10rP2SsCAxUIz4WFUl5o-lKQUEUlbLwFYB63eGVl9W8t61NOVnLQI2_EM507Showy98PMGEeGC7RqBohCl7lNhe0JcOABLsjlmZkSpm44C71kXSvO0U8NrqesBhjBqz18tvRR0hqV6Wh-2Pkk054ED8VtkkaQRBjcGs-H_3lJjZBbyXhbVNE_7VgkyH6q8umRAaJ5cjbBKf1DVvCSjQr4pS97Y_6n44qysKUCW-k7ccgrD_CD5FLj4Xt5jA3Rh3fKTiQzDu5KQblyBpNYYWKyzm_YUREPGDXzqHEW7j7cbAOhxukfTBgQpTiA9eRCcNlRmdbQWTdoxdiBKeph8jJTJCgxDXDcdE540-NVftBcQT-r6RfNgBV62yNTYjSbb34pytSA44c3FzxtuRPaZ6J8THgfYVQ0vt0WLnpEAU2eTEdwiEIcHWP3gabQ_GOHwMmelIDN1_jenvDtbgQ9wVGv2liNabDSVzWrJbTbrQxCofnRQfI1cOJTdWzCPU2Q8GCb-yWu5qFXl2cjsJs=w278-h156-no');

Signs indicate that they, like the objects found by the same team earlier this year, are likely dwarf satellite galaxies, the smallest and closest known form of galaxies.\r\n\r\n<p>Satellite galaxies are small celestial objects that orbit larger galaxies, such as our Milky Way. Dwarf galaxies can be found with fewer than 1,000 stars, in contrast to the Milky Way, an average-sized galaxy containing billions of stars. Scientists have predicted that larger galaxies are built from smaller galaxies, which are thought to be especially rich in dark matter, the substance that makes up about 25 percent of the total matter and energy in the universe. Dwarf satellite galaxies, therefore, are considered key to understanding dark matter and the process by which larger galaxies form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main goal of the DES, as its name suggests, is to better understand the nature of dark energy, the mysterious stuff that makes up about 70 percent of the matter and energy in the universe. Scientists believe that dark energy is the key to understanding why the expansion of the universe is speeding up. To carry out its dark energy mission, DES takes snapshots of hundreds of millions of distant galaxies. However, some of the DES images also contain stars in dwarf galaxies much closer to the Milky Way. The same data can therefore be used to probe both dark energy, which scientists think is driving galaxies apart, and dark matter, which is thought to hold galaxies together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists can only see the faintest dwarf galaxies when they are nearby and had previously found only a few. If these new discoveries are representative of the entire sky, there could be many more galaxies hiding in our cosmic neighborhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just this year, more than 20 of these dwarf satellite galaxy candidates have been spotted, with 17 of those found in Dark Energy Survey data,” said Alex Drlica-Wagner of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. “We’ve nearly doubled the number of these objects we know about in just one year, which is remarkable.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March, researchers with the DES and an independent team from the University of Cambridge jointly announced the discovery of nine of these objects in snapshots taken by the Dark Energy Camera, the extraordinary instrument at the heart of the DES, an experiment funded by the DOE, the National Science Foundation, and other funding agencies. Two of those have been confirmed as dwarf satellite galaxies so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to 2015, scientists had located only about two dozen such galaxies around the Milky Way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“DES is finding galaxies so faint that they would have been very difficult to recognize in previous surveys,” said Keith Bechtol of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “The discovery of so many new galaxy candidates in one-eighth of the sky could mean there are more to find around the Milky Way.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The closest of these newly discovered objects is about 80,000 light-years away and the farthest roughly 700,000 light-years away. These objects are, on average, around a billion times dimmer than the Milky Way and a million times less massive. The faintest of the new dwarf galaxy candidates has about 500 stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the newly discovered objects are in the southern half of the DES survey area, in close proximity to the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud. These are the two largest satellite galaxies associated with the Milky Way, about 158,000 light-years and 208,000 light-years away, respectively. It is possible that many of these new objects could be satellite galaxies of these larger satellite galaxies, which would be a discovery by itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That result would be fascinating,” said Risa Wechsler of DOE’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. “Satellites of satellites are predicted by our models of dark matter. Either we are seeing these types of systems for the first time, or there is something we don’t understand about how these satellite galaxies are distributed in the sky.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since dwarf galaxies are thought to be made mostly of dark matter with very few stars, they are excellent targets to explore the properties of dark matter. Further analysis will confirm whether these new objects are indeed dwarf satellite galaxies and whether signs of dark matter can be detected from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 17 dwarf satellite galaxy candidates were discovered in the first two years of data collected by the Dark Energy Survey, a five-year effort to photograph a portion of the southern sky in unprecedented detail. Scientists have now had a first look at most of the survey area, but data from the next three years of the survey will likely allow them to find objects that are even fainter, more diffuse, or farther away. The third survey season has just begun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This exciting discovery is the product of a strong collaborative effort from the entire DES team,” said Basilio Santiago from the DES Milky Way Science Working Group and a member of the DES-Brazil Consortium. “We’ve only just begun our probe of the cosmos, and we’re looking forward to more exciting discoveries in the coming years.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://astronomy.com">astronomy.com</a></p>', '/resources/images/news/DarkEnergySurvey.jpg'),

', 'The Moon''s thin atmosphere contains neon, a gas commonly used in electric signs on Earth because of its intense glow. While scientists have speculated on the presence of neon in the lunar atmosphere for decades, NASA''s Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft has confirmed its existence for the first time.\r\n\r\n<p>“The presence of neon in the exosphere of the Moon has been a subject of speculation since the Apollo missions, but no credible detections were made," said Mehdi Benna of NASA''s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. "We were very pleased to not only finally confirm its presence, but to show that it is relatively abundant."</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There''s not enough neon to make the Moon visibly glow because its atmosphere is extremely tenuous, about 100 trillion times less dense than Earth''s atmosphere at sea level. A dense atmosphere like Earth''s is relatively rare in our solar system because an object has to be sufficiently massive to have enough gravity to hold onto it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The behavior of a dense atmosphere is driven by collisions between its atoms and molecules. However, the Moon''s atmosphere is technically referred to as an exosphere because it’s so thin, its atoms rarely collide. Exospheres are the most common type of atmosphere in our solar system, so scientists are interested in learning more about them. "It''s critical to learn about the lunar exosphere before sustained human exploration substantially alters it," Benna said. Since the Moon''s atmosphere is so thin, rocket exhaust and outgassing from spacecraft could easily change its composition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the Moon''s exosphere comes from the solar wind, a thin stream of electrically conducting gas blown from the surface of the Sun into space at around a million miles per hour. Most of the solar wind is hydrogen and helium, but it contains many other elements in small amounts, including neon. All these elements impact the Moon, but only helium, neon, and argon are volatile enough to be returned back to space. The rest of the elements will stick indefinitely to the Moon’s surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LADEE NMS instrument confirms that the Moon’s exosphere is made up of mostly helium, argon, and neon. Their relative abundance is dependent on the time of day on the Moon — argon peaks at sunrise, with neon at 4 a.m. and helium at 1 a.m. The instrument conducted systematic measurements of these gases for seven months, which allowed the team to understand how these gases are supplied to the exosphere and how they are ultimately lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While most of the lunar exosphere comes from the solar wind, NMS showed that some gas comes from lunar rocks. Argon-40 results from the decay of naturally occurring radioactive potassium-40, found in the rocks of all the terrestrial planets as a leftover from their formation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>"We were also surprised to find that argon-40 creates a local bulge above an unusual part of the Moon''s surface, the region containing Mare Imbrium and Oceanus Procellarum," said Benna. Although the reason for this local enhancement is not yet understood, "One could not help to notice that this region happens to be the place where potassium-40 is most abundant on the surface. So there may be a connection between the atmospheric argon, the surface potassium, and deep interior sources," said Benna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A second surprising behavior of argon was that the overall amount in the lunar exosphere was not constant over time. Instead, it increased and then decreased by about 25 percent during the course of the LADEE mission. According to Benna, this transient source of argon may be the result of enhanced outgassing from the surface that is triggered by tidal stress on the Moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NMS also revealed an unexpected source of some of the helium in the lunar exosphere. "About 20 percent of the helium is coming from the Moon itself, most likely as the result from the decay of radioactive thorium and uranium, also found in lunar rocks," said Benna. This helium is being produced at a rate equivalent to about 7 quarts (7 liters) per second at standard atmospheric pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>"The data collected by the NMS addresses the long-standing questions related to the sources and sinks of exospheric helium and argon that have remained unanswered for four decades," said Benna. "These discoveries highlight the limitations of current exospheric models and the need for more sophisticated ones in the future."</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://astronomy.com">astronomy.com</a></p>', '/resources/images/news/ladeelunarorbit.jpg'),

It has now been recalibrated and shows a consistent history of solar activity over the past few centuries. The new record shows no significant long-term upward trend in solar activity since 1700, as was previously indicated. This suggests that rising global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution cannot be attributed to increased solar activity. The analysis, its results, and its implications for climate research were made public at he International Astronomical Union XXIX General Assembly, currently taking place in Honolulu, Hawaii.\r\n\r\n<p>The Maunder minimum, between 1645 and 1715, when sunspots were scarce and the winters harsh, strongly suggests a link between solar activity and climate change. Until now there was a general consensus that solar activity has been trending upward over the past 300 years (since the end of the Maunder minimum), peaking in the late 20th century — called the Modern Grand Maximum by some.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This trend has led some to conclude that the Sun has played a significant role in modern climate change. However, a discrepancy between two parallel series of sunspot number counts has been a contentious issue among scientists for some time.</p>\r\n<p>The two methods of counting the sunspot number — the Wolf Sunspot Number and the Group Sunspot Number — indicated significantly different levels of solar activity before about 1885 and also around 1945. With these discrepancies now eliminated, there is no longer any substantial difference between the two historical records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new correction of the sunspot number, called the Sunspot Number Version 2.0, led by Frédéric Clette, director of the World Data Centre–SILSO, Ed Cliver of the National Solar Observatory, and Leif Svalgaard of Stanford University, nullifies the claim that there has been a Modern Grand Maximum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results make it difficult to explain the observed changes in the climate that started in the 18th century and extended through the Industrial Revolution to the 20th century as being significantly influenced by natural solar trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sunspot number is the only direct record of the evolution of the solar cycle over multiple centuries and is the longest scientific experiment still ongoing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The apparent upward trend of solar activity between the 18th century and the late 20th century has now been identified as a major calibration error in the Group Sunspot Number. Now that this error has been corrected, solar activity appears to have remained relatively stable since the 1700s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newly corrected sunspot numbers now provide a homogenous record of solar activity dating back some 400 years. Existing climate evolution models will need to be reevaluated given this entirely new picture of the long-term evolution of solar activity. This work will stimulate new studies both in solar physics (solar cycle modeling and predictions) and climatology, and can be used to unlock tens of millennia of solar records encoded in cosmogenic nuclides found in ice cores and tree rings. This could reveal more clearly the role the Sun plays in climate change over much longer timescales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://astronomy.com">astronomy.com</a></p>', '/resources/images/news/Sunspots.jpg'),

', 'Astronomers using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and the 6.5-meter Clay Telescope in Chile have identified the smallest supermassive black hole ever detected in the center of a galaxy. This oxymoronic object could provide clues to how larger black holes formed along with their host galaxies 13 billion years or more in the past.\r\n\r\n<p>Astronomers estimate this supermassive black hole is about 50,000 times the mass of the Sun. This is less than half the mass of the previous smallest black hole at the center of a galaxy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It might sound contradictory, but finding such a small, large black hole is very important,” said Vivienne Baldassare of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “We can use observations of the lightest supermassive black holes to better understand how black holes of different sizes grow.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tiny heavyweight black hole is in the center of a dwarf disk galaxy, called RGG 118, located about 340 million light-years from Earth, and was originally discovered using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers estimated the mass of the black hole by studying the motion of cool gas near the center of the galaxy using visible-light data from the Clay Telescope. They used the Chandra data to figure out the X-ray brightness of hot gas swirling toward the black hole. They found the outward push of radiation pressure of this hot gas is about 1 percent of the black hole’s inward pull of gravity, matching the properties of other supermassive black holes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, scientists had noted a relationship between the mass of supermassive black holes and the range of velocities of stars in the centers of their host galaxies. This relationship also holds for RGG 118 and its black hole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We found this little supermassive black hole behaves very much like its bigger, and in some cases much bigger, cousins,” said Amy Reines of the University of Michigan. “This tells us black holes grow in a similar way no matter what their size.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The black hole in RGG 118 is nearly 100 times less massive than the supermassive black hole found in the center of the Milky Way. It’s also about 200,000 times less massive than the heaviest black holes found in the centers of other galaxies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Astronomers are trying to understand the formation of billion-solar-mass black holes from less than a billion years after the Big Bang, but many are undetectable with current technology. The black hole in RGG 118 gives astronomers an opportunity to study a nearby small supermassive black hole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Astronomers think supermassive black holes may form when a large cloud of gas, with a mass of about 10,000 to 100,000 times that of the Sun, collapses into a black hole. Many of these black hole seeds then merge to form much larger supermassive black holes. Alternately, a supermassive black hole seed could come from a giant star, about 100 times the Sun’s mass, that ultimately forms into a black hole after it runs out of fuel and collapses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We have two main ideas for how these supermassive black holes are born,” said Elena Gallo of the University of Michigan. “This black hole in RGG 118 is serving as a proxy for those in the very early universe and ultimately may help us decide which of the two is right.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers will continue to look for other supermassive black holes that are comparable in size or even smaller than the one in RGG 118 to help decide which of the models is more accurate and refine their understanding of how these objects grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://astronomy.com">astronomy.com</a></p>', '/resources/images/news/blackhole.jpg'),

', 'San Diego State University (SDSU) astronomers have discovered the 10th known "transiting circumbinary" exoplanet, which orbits two stars and therefore has two suns.\r\n\r\n<p>Astronomers at the 29th International Astronomical Union General Assembly will announce August 14 the discovery of a new transiting circumbinary planet, bringing the number of such known exoplanets into double digits. A circumbinary planet orbits two stars, and like the fictional planet “Tatooine” from Star Wars, this planet has two suns in its sky. The discovery marks an important milestone and comes only four years after the first Kepler circumbinary exoplanet was detected. Once thought to be rare or even impossible, these 10 discoveries confirm that such planets are common in our galaxy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new planet, known as Kepler-453b, also presented astronomers with a surprising twist — the tilt of the orbit of the exoplanet rapidly changes, making transits visible only 9 percent of the time. “The detection was a lucky catch for Kepler,” said William Welsh, professor of astronomy at SDSU and lead author of the study. “Most of the time, transits would not be visible from Earth''s vantage point.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The change of orientation of the planet''s orbital plane, known as precession, brought it into proper alignment halfway through the space telescope''s lifetime, allowing three transits to be observed before the end of the mission. “The low probability for witnessing transits means that for every system like Kepler-453 we see, there are likely to be 11 times as many that we don''t see,” added co-author Jerome Orosz, also a professor of astronomy at SDSU. The precession period is estimated to be approximately 103 years. The next set of transits won''t be visible again until the year 2066.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kepler-453b is the third Kepler circumbinary exoplanet found to lie in the habitable zone of its host pair of stars. The astonishingly high rate of occurrence in the habitable zone is caused by the types of stars observed by Kepler (generally Sun-like) and the need for the planet to be sufficiently far from the stars for its orbit to be stable. In a binary star system, the habitable zone is more complex than around a single star, but it can be readily calculated once astronomers know the masses, radii, and temperatures of the stars. However, Kepler-453b is a gas giant exoplanet and is unlikely to harbor life as we know it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the amount of starlight blocked during the transits, astronomers deduced that Kepler-453b has a radius 6.2 times that of Earth. The mass of the exoplanet was not measurable with the current data, but is likely to be less than 16 times that of Earth. The planet takes 240 days to orbit its parent stars, while the stars orbit each other every 27 days. The larger star is similar to our Sun, containing 94 percent as much mass, while the smaller star contains only 20 percent as much mass and is far cooler and fainter. The system is in the direction of the constellation Lyra, some 1,400 light-years away, and is estimated to be between 1 and 2 billion years old, much younger than our solar system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the number of known circumbinary exoplanets now at 10, astronomers can begin to compare different systems and look for trends. The systems tend to be very compact, and they come in a wide range of configurations. “The diversity and complexity of these circumbinary systems are wonderful,” Welsh said. “Each new circumbinary planet is a gem, revealing something unexpected and challenging.” And their tendency to be in the habitable zone is a bonus, spurring astronomers to keep searching for Earth-sized circumbinary planets in the Kepler archive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The finding complements SDSU''s previous success with Kepler data. In 2012, Welsh and Orosz discovered the first instance of a two-planet circumbinary system: two exoplanets orbiting a pair of suns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These discoveries were made possible by NASA''s Kepler mission, whose precision and long-term monitoring of the same set of stars made it an ideal planet-discovery telescope. Although the mission ended in 2012, the space telescope continues to collect data as the K2 mission, and the archive of data from Kepler will keep astronomers busy for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source: <a href="http://astronomy.com">astronomy.com</a></p>', '/resources/images/news/tatuooin.jpg');

(1, 'Mercury', 0, 2439.7, 'Mercury is the smallest and closest to the Sun of the eight planets in the Solar System, with an orbital period of about 88 Earth days. Seen from Earth, it appears to move around its orbit in about 116 days, which is much faster than any other planet in the Solar System. It has no known natural satellites. The planet is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger to the gods.\r\n\r\n<p>Because it has almost no atmosphere to retain heat, Mercury''s surface experiences the greatest temperature variation of the planets in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day at some equatorial regions. The poles are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). Mercury''s axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System''s planets (about 1⁄30 of a degree), but it has the largest orbital eccentricity. At aphelion, Mercury is about 1.5 times as far from the Sun as it is at perihelion. Mercury''s surface is heavily cratered and similar in appearance to the Moon, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercury is gravitationally locked and rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. As seen relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth''s orbit (as does Venus), it can appear in Earth''s sky in the morning or the evening, but not in the middle of the night. Also, like Venus and the Moon, it displays a complete range of phases as it moves around its orbit relative to Earth. Although Mercury can appear as a bright object when viewed from Earth, its proximity to the Sun makes it more difficult to see than Venus. Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in the 1970s; and MESSENGER, launched in 2004, orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years, before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet''s surface on April 30, 2015.</p>', 400, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KNioJy8TgM_vwbIBaJJpi1NpH7gt11CaiJjdE4b7tVdZXahsLFUdpBms8lglYjiSzZbY5aXEqA7HKqw0iFdqZ2nKkF_08vbr3_4cg8XEknZG4cG0IX4eL7qeHjcssM-Tp_tjgo3v-jUmXNZt5sVC8wXRWqLS1Rrrw3m-twDvbBC1HpsmIv3Z-3GLTpHEmNbyvyZUmL8ivSn_mqeVAqvn45y5-Al5JXF_VYXr17ZN-JP7saLl5owjFLxBRi7MweYt7vaUX5nYuKJbn3mEQkKfK3nYdMk04DgXgoLzMxEE3i3TL3KcJEP1QRqfAu5Aztsln05nfG-Zbmp0vtwFk1YtgGzaGhWkx0o8hR7K6umxgeDSM7JJH_z2w9ueg4ZRaqBBba7ieG6u4e2lgkRp4-Bf6nUOvocnJ5W9tYbz49ZRcVLtr-BLrcYsOnGr5jHXNUu6QfM8YSIQ2qNHtw4hHkRmmKZmDiAL_02hW2VHdbMHu9U8njPMSS4C2toFPkpp0amxUVB0tGM3bwjkR5mVRNHCleYqHlG4_9zlBomrQgpxceQ=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bNE83UX7rGlXEQFRTEt3XOdB_xrCGE6Mv3ES0pzNI1j-G9kasM0jcG2iWneAhEuLIU5R1pFgxQpfpykWpbT3O46NjgDhQeWS8M5GIHDrrX5SWGcVeriEaaqw_jr78XWcjSlWAoOzR4mLQs0Zk19LZHauip4zqh_E4ZPMix6m3XQtpw-YMKIsmRgp2Omdg3PcsH4o7JB680uPh763E_AFxOrePbzQnssKV2aP85pwh8olVf3OhjBSF0ahmcJUFjCw_pgCJ_c5K-YSvnonyI9jUA6YlVExX1PUSSfxIMwG_CwouKUpzN3fqVYsTal5WTteUCwquXiFlnQEDyPkYdkKnl4IGUEefymvhQuS4FvzAkQM_IEMi5udTsdpzeQ9LRmY7xj1QetIYTEjYG1ajHtgW4RIaLLLVAcdRt5SfMsAQuZ9A-07EhBlj6GhdzXJkKta2M05H0ZLRTUpAOzikA7QR0G4SPlMxnsoOzVhTgaE-o85wnCPLhCU1V4c6VSniyBAHdrHTNCDIKjtcJHRF_GVTqdi15p_LSafqzTWlt8lbeY=w600-h330-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QhSLTEnPmgr24coHyR9eGFPRjoKW63bNX1NJ9Ty63re8zho2ZMNWF4fd2D5VceiCQdQFFfYcv38HxRINzWYI7-T_RuALqhLF92OaouWQvQX06eg4d99NiRfHhgP7qpoPcq6J_q3Yz2YB13SPdsHfkMPjBwkVuECbZKEbO9hL3LPe7e7iTLKm9w-rB7HhovMb4rBXEQvEtMeAjcqZXh1muGjFhKyhHiSSnp70G2Awyb5QKGVY6MWumNYRGS5vmGprix0iFqC-XQY-kRiISxhsLFfYW1hBWim1nNCS417QaRc9hbUt3CoTiDTroMbqhnV8PAyEsGlwKMHc_Uc5QGcn1vVuNvUAeznwBNyLtlK8_5UZZBZMVsk9KBh1dd4zm17LshLRc9S67gNN24LGDAztZLtAAWwERanscf3CAijpCg270JSl9oM0dp0l1xQTB8uSQCAXZ-aOQlgFrLM6kKExaCJ9MG4qP2VyfV1Jm02RfKqHoIAp_H4J1Fmg37vz6aYNsAB_udzx6Hd4MI54PtM8eqSMu0Gd9U_l9nTd56EvWtM=w1024-h778-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Et35lG5QkGCCeGUKGY2r_VLaLL6eYhor-6xUVsAbvk-1IfawDrnifWVVmLo4V5dXgWYbDogiN3-vPWFx0pJTdnSzWhbxFRkYxC1UdmC5fKWzNJVIuZUdhILGR4GH6O8xoTn7Hcny5dGeEKpD_zR8PxeG2W1xXeVxo_HH9-5csYwsJx-zN495yI6JZN_r36-yIos35vBJPtT-Pl45m-1ZBDip3cj408DPEy9sPTbwB7uZkCiyMbJwf2vKDmJ9GoIW4rAiHQrZzTMYDrqzxb05ZSMREO1j4i71nUqpfz78Ddf_4dTIw3526cxx1HgfD8FYZw3HZQiGMwskglu6u5r2S-5OBIMnEo-IlASBl8lgbaNQ6MUAGqQh9VbXZjHH4wJKJJ2ThfNl74Zh1anny9_VILirEjkcNtdZ7uGfkPFTkJ6h-VgiUz4NIWFZR-X8sIKuhZhiu4nwc7qbA8PIPybYiQGJqt_v0qH_DrETAlVUCCIxe-XI6aRhU5zScCxeepipYMhr8XX5hQNnOcHN6OQ_c-SxfQbvqUZ6PTPq4TXYCfw=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OpJi74eTx1iDGEWtZVrpeeWTT4WwFsm8aNYPmMfhVxFF-OU1feNS3TarhV_R106zbUJjN01h3DXR3JnO3cgM-ft9vPcCo9Fcw6oIxQnixNh7bvadT7mjvWUkfIdBBMlPiZPOiRrr1HEY5Bfm7nsLJbpcZnEGLuwtkSDDf-QVygnwfDSZ0VnuVe-tsgYF7pry3FX-JChT9vB-A93Ej_74ZnEScwaNjnJAwIYyeACYhKCwYjwYMeKcW5RohsX1QOynodcuM4Xut283Zby8njMINxZ6MdOp9hVkasBdDNd1R48w9s905jkvUuLIKtFCKqRPv_vYf5CSLAQNCxV4yCGLmABfNyTYo4PqR9HVO6sUXyp1ZlIPbKgRDsHdwTL3mZvn5jz1IGtctnTC5VximAN2GORIC7tgYsD2_0DM8zaKaOiemhzWPMvocTYUMkkmtRIWFx-Tft71fRchs3h92mt1qerhGcGm45KMu3jc2xnEp1xB5WcEjVcbZi91XGf1i-iaplNxSdOCVxzPBY6hwjXXF_ZZSaxhq7Y4sXQ4LdTM7DY=w278-h156-no'),
(2, 'Venus', 0, 6051.8, 'Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has no natural satellite. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object in the night sky, reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6, bright enough to cast shadows. Because Venus is an inferior planet from Earth, it never appears to venture far from the Sun: its elongation reaches a maximum of 47.8°.\r\n\r\n<p>Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth''s "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet''s surface is 92 times that of Earth''s. With a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F), Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus has no carbon cycle that puts carbon into rock, nor does it seem to have any organic life to absorb carbon in biomass. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have had oceans in the past, but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect. The water has most probably photodissociated, and, because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field, the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind. Venus''s surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like rocks and periodically refreshed by volcanism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, meaning that, like Earth, it is a rocky body. In size and mass, it is similar to Earth, and is often described as Earth''s "sister" or "twin". The diameter of Venus is 12,092 km (only 650 km less than Earth''s) and its mass is 81.5% of Earth''s. Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because of its dense carbon dioxide atmosphere. The mass of the atmosphere of Venus is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.</p>', 737, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VlYCGHTBIM0Zu736a_b9zsZcACuYkQCh0I9zpXiktay2Z-unnbZZLiUenJm5C6UNRwnGIKkNFDn0ASZEEE2AwNUfggcI6SVx6NtdSi6fQ3b6PYzlL2IHRksz8-LkWGyzPvrZViXbJ7TXHEzQVKVEz1mbM-eg_TwA3dKCPuQoBKFUIhhO6M2w48DZmGgTwnulpVOaijtHPrzBh4Nm3zc-C0i878sSva9sMqJ_6qidvB0WdVDaKYcZexKUtzLSWDU7EnBRVUE30uPeHl8Pu9rT8npZ9L7Uv442H3NNQPA0eQ3u7vrkwXg-mQiAbaEYkzKXztUWqoxX7ySsEewcS7-hMwxD0YPt2HpgwBjPyrT3LMqyUQneLUeWALzm0cqtEEqUZp9BCFzGLrdWkhuzgqNZxf6wkuEND1Au8wK4jaUQZwQ7v2iwwHliuEpL22NZCqQkK43w4KG-t--cuDPvabelYexxffw6mXEhmzYoJfEiow5N6NJq7oUmAVvjku7eaWHzmSKfMeiLSq4-WE9CI8YRNqXwo1tvXWYSm460Zz6c4bE=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/swZ40uY8YAPQi1OwsC_sd2MQy3HMFvX44OLkx5HwBTVhfJjvGUBAhJrO7BuGvEqvW8jDy1JIJyFOgvbXnIpehZ1efqydi3Xgwx4_ozS1qYE9c9tz2MRlctLVgoKwwVQ9Lx-gVYr_xlo0TdQUFRffYJPBDHRi819XrmH8g3psNUpXejxCiBIxPj2f2kdVQPmbIr7JIyytA1UTuLRdf66KnQTLZKffXYqRqCEAQxTBVVpuwmnuULSGEZSNkM9c952DDWY_oVWzv3JZ6PjNHmlO4MVQfvoafcf3WZBKwJGd7sb8A6s61l2v8hM783mWouxyzK-qFC8FuP0IAVKASXHHgMLn8-dhbeWV46It2NLkd4zL9RKBleRJPlqXBLHLz5iVPBtMj7yQEQlUlo-s263Ytn4QjkOop_3gh8p8w2h9HHNa2tHmRSkFQia6onVbpmIobt3IrRRBp0gyllqLjb397U4rbEM1b2rzMuvZa5Kg8FaP5zQdf7UCtfF6Fm7viXccivGeznIy9NXRQ1uyijXcyJBGXvBCXifdhBlV6HDgJwU=w1496-h650-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/429_ZNzOZom_8ijHGb6kvXRCLXLSOD4HHAB2yUj4OGIjEgDe5pli1pSrZR9n9SfklgkrlrGtGNF3oMNDdsPc3bylDkef3jSozueF2W7AlG6csa3dYw0PPstXRxZ2Dx45ZIZDA9mMuYiguYu9Ux_a3QE9rHhTnQtKTqXHmSSJea7uPTrKiBSIBaXwehpA3if_JzYCk8Qcc1pnKmGSG5_qJ7jDTcoPB8ZIc11x3zOkyTYc25XVVRY2InFAQlEY8JLpIO741d9rcdDjIr8BXwPg9ktivoPlVGvDxwJdASXa6YGdGvCQ1mhTyuDVn6yCOCIo6WE9BoCi3xsd7-xLBjI6BWIRMyVPTPOArs-yTaqTxZlEctKk1rOT_9QfPwDaG7jHKxCvfHwEK0iV5z4UlAUgxGh1XXu_mcteZRJAOnkYpGBcuzyDWDkejgfsNSljfuh5XKsDAu0rqs6g7V-Sv71-CIRC-6_d-5lwu8Bo7N-kAJXKG_776OOSAszB0C4RWAnGDpa-1PttjK0SxsCXDEiBJbqXM45hlDkgX5duKZ-zM8k=w640-h320-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/L6zLQWl-5cPN3ciHetA3pgN9T9rfxixUI7PgJqnNjAeaZvw1FtKUlX2Yqjxx0FCUOjwpHossIT2iw9qqCTkgjPo3tA9T6Av0HpoSOnleQkZWBevm9TJmpTCS8N_6knAiwF6DKE6RlKJb0rtt3CRBvRp6sBC-QR-kGwEnnVjB0fE3o4SmSXg8sy6bqq68h-AfA2LzmYwHDdVtQrobzZ5IDk9b7n6YAWR8IqjvufMvMJLKu--P-LulhSlQTLLYjzHQ5bjLMDPtHTDZwgomNkt408d9SOb9XaGWgSww3EY7DQ8VRBrmR5ci4M-l1utvtof7DFRsqK2pSK1uwkxEFGKT8zWxsTBQHzZ2NR-ZCHOslU67F1fUFty9DjZeSMXTwmVkdz2CZZ7pEK2a5Q8_1Ddir6EBewMJUpCDbl6iCXYPIFRzeVPTvYe5tOg5GY895juNKNBBY1LrtOrv_nof3HfcbMQ8VhaX2VlMs4Wk551ejjHJ3DOJr44YA0JDCD1YT7chy4jR-enoCydjp4ciwMJaRFOr4StFFbwW_qqUf37m714=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p6ylzEPlOnKf6t8Os3v42PkG1FqxoRdQjxp5KegkZaXkM8dWBR3ubkwt7C3H-dCu8T9s7gT4BJBM7gn1iF1osGYPImSrbkeQpLZWiTnYCQM7GyGVmA8OdnVJTKAPJpsbYUzess0OBGQt9wSCshkpgQUllYzyzhfeFdeplDlmUx2LB-aQMB4A8nkB-x4zhl0fvJtI1-TzGMbDmpgTi9v3IVoxOr6fVvc0DHByq3Opvl62_uCQF7w3hRMq387kvjca3J-dDka8SVLxkT-F7rTpxORWMoa72paNlEMaHpJ5kW3AWqaKjWvEagpcVc0UgvJDe-wcN_hm2DHaf8bELSoVCr2s6DtiqnlG683BhdtDBhWvdIJTnviPxYsIKxPVKnhcx-S26g6WAUJQxKs02wiUJXDy3TwWHejivFDMOfb1KDXt-9cqTauuhmSfQKBi_EcJV4KIFwC7kx2lrqidEfKkDLeTc9yPdj65QZFaj8um4-rwEguraGYtoVp_lyUOCqGIAnYvchc09HDCiM60F3nHKtUah0NBWajdOYF0FvJLBhg=w278-h156-no'),
(3, 'Earth', 1, 6371, 'Earth, also called the world and, less frequently, Gaia (and Terra in some works of science fiction) is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System''s four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to accommodate life. The earliest life on Earth arose at least 3.5 billion years ago. Earth''s biodiversity has expanded continually except when interrupted by mass extinctions. Although scholars estimate that over 99 percent of all species of life (over five billion) that ever lived on Earth are extinct, there are still an estimated 10–14 million extant species, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described. Over 7.3 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and minerals for their survival. Earth''s human population is divided among about two hundred sovereign states which interact through diplomacy, conflict, travel, trade and communication media.\r\n\r\n<p>According to evidence from radiometric dating and other sources, Earth was formed about 4.54 billion years ago. Within its first billion years, life appeared in its oceans and began to affect its atmosphere and surface, promoting the proliferation of aerobic as well as anaerobic organisms and causing the formation of the atmosphere''s ozone layer. This layer and the geomagnetic field blocked the most life-threatening parts of the Sun''s radiation, so life was able to flourish on land as well as in water. Since then, the combination of Earth''s distance from the Sun, its physical properties and its geological history have allowed life to thrive and evolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earth''s lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. Seventy-one percent of Earth''s surface is covered with water, with the remainder consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. Earth''s polar regions are mostly covered with ice that includes the solid ice of the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the polar ice packs. Earth''s interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the magnetic field, and a thick layer of relatively solid mantle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon. During one orbit around the Sun, Earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times, creating 365.26 solar days or one sidereal year. Earth''s axis of rotation is tilted 23.4° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane, producing seasonal variations on the planet''s surface with a period of one tropical year (365.24 solar days). The Moon is Earth''s only natural satellite. It began orbiting Earth about 4.53 billion years ago. The Moon''s gravitational interaction with Earth stimulates ocean tides, stabilizes the axial tilt and gradually slows the planet''s rotation.</p>', 288, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Kf_IVAMK8iL4glYmvdM4XvVEQrMciLDuoYhYWzRNtcqFpsDUw0IFLJtiwdXiSwUAgiRBNrmQnM6PasByexPi-gYsOhVflC9ekxqS3nB4slUAxMswb1bCqMtG30qXuWJ7DhVRHud4zYVgAq-w0Hy-h6GNpJ0x7F1A6l9RmyW5QXpIydB5vNaVjJwTzmYuLi35ofKIifx-hj0OWt_4L2v3Grh_w6SiGSm-t4Do80effINLoUzKsnY6DMBLl26MJMRuMel35EiFhWt4HBjVmaygTxnTNTzaozUkf-Ex23iZmMaRTPkK1jTjoFvV3kOJC73borlr99SfKz6Jg0gTtAC7UhZXiz1W2gonMTHfJzrE8V66wMnQ0JHsiJGR7OixPhzHYYWuvbj0dZnZr0TFuM4czqJH1QQYWT-2vZrkba5dYqsEsVTVOJPUfvdwDFiBW4I3qfzRfn8qs8yFpor7IXx_dAEkmHfFhBl61Dx-sHs_EbJzDyiT2YjloQ4tfwD-1Um5DWhyF9VhLPA2oK-O5sYkcm2VxxaRm7YHdFexdWTVWgk=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8RnSU7_AawVDZjfH39F1Z3-aHo8kL2MkYZdHkS_7OEjDQl4ghBc7rQVTjo4Vt702UzYeNGChe3pE7xuyofRFk4E4PJSqldB2ZrshFIrpuOAPADhVdXSIKTz02m3ueY_EGI-iiqNKRScMxXfKFK8xtgrbPJcwiaF4X93eZJuTDxi_x2S5Q0p6LUU5xTQAqF1vSECaPHDh7zs2s9GuIUqHVrtKZh9n7dteHVyOh0BFrA5dgpJszCVp781_P7JyCPXwXoDEKFzSSOEMcDj5lI0TIiD9bFn8RVTeSXYDXsmFrJFDK4WQDGAA7usw_xRoS_jncChoEvlACur29ZyhYPiJJLku4D7xvsCpcJZmZ2KoWxqnmupRsGVLgFc50Jge7xVXkvX2NrJJxJrjMCIZLdfc-JfNW9nbQ-oBF3uWqEU49jmYOrVyRBclbP6OeYSz6yZVatqO1QZ-KKjyEbRrAwcR5SuVkeWQRUOChBv54XgFIBpQKFERd_dD5YjTN5O_Skc9LY__VR50KdZ71XZyqwxpa7yUF3KXwL55erAatO7hVyY=w1421-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mqvsYcucKM8xcbwzcyA3fDr3WpUeakGzrECCtrZ-v8N5YdcMliHFuFkeZos3J_DgDoSnDHGw2VDXk1sB65EqsCCXPh9Q-J2xAwno6Ze4zhffk9ILMs_rdgOoObO1H2yoihpx4bO-JpxlKRoQwwOXCUNbcMs-30E-anwPS-k_6hl0YWoHQmRu4qpr_AYb4XllUu8ZumdebEA6Wgu6MmmEQgIUHgmg2FeYByeAU6G6NaoRYW60rFw4qWo6oJahAwycStrlK2Ky5zG5AWBucBhyO6DhvtP1JZKSprQHWxumAlj4t0tDrpqkX1OzIT7ZUiSIL8hbESMXY7KsasKMGJWRS4Iq74UxAzE7eXQAmNdD14gfbgfHiH4-am3EiDwIBuC2a5SITHEekci4g2QCg_vpdW6WTYGny7p3goDXccdmV4PSRDbZt9GoA5LMKM7tC9KnI-YZNWI3NeGvCD5VcVCKY575UEITTjHC05-8RC_pNhGMFBHKUnL3d_I-sbdxUwPETfyEC4hbPd3-6NfbOU-ddqaY9JH0ZdmsqhCz3gFG9KE=w807-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uxQk9zShMlnd5zTecq6eagRBhRMk7eLchWIo1Y-iyi_cxgJV0mjpc5xIx652cYo02NHDSx8jy9K75ElLPE8JT2GMfPKkah0df6jhW4_npX9mqhyBhyaWJLr7voquP7RTxKi9KtoZvoxob3F9Q1mBFT2BY--7jNd0eX5uAebOIXMa5ISlvuOQG38KKLdYarBOy56ytUUzVLtSHjkCpsRPgsCfBO0BcrIGestJeYVSCQQ3iOTh6s80RJZHGvMXJd14_W9sg73XpVclCT2QOCON_ItB_EjlbSBkJbluGduwY-loQLdnAkaZ8LKwIsCMRC9hfF1PkBpkAW-54bU4tOnVmUrqPZpKaG5N5pKgNk4DucbEPlAS_8MaZ74k57VaPve59E39IKxgFOVAvM758lrex03oiAq3zQfeIWMrufdqSSLTDlgpGvApK4gpFP-3sWo2ZWqD6dhFc3FqiK4fpf9LwOpgNjZ_deH06h9GVPZUQodfEd3AtKaXJO8A9xDZziKnLblifB7CtMUN1S2WDQJ6ViCCIlivLPQ_PtWZMvDG4jc=w1199-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/88TsHEQobPwe9W9FwK8OjLzVyn1XDlbAMH0wi9T7R6fPIKVPkGtWMZm5ZNRJWe-AOkeZwsG3SXJixXjC3p-6PAEFzFDvLiMcmAXKNltEPky62PqdmCLqprIQbue7FpvOhwDn9JGywIXBvdh-QS3GGw4QHPimQ3_4tB1MgyCrYTKin5guEQN-k6SB3eZeS4XoLmXo0_tf2XTERickajnGInoBkf2wa2Zw4Ln712YnCMdEIwGEl8basKDLZGCunix9DPjrF88nnpGg8UEABzHnhfkc8li_7ca4RYhS8J9yhOP43xhYZNXO-OjW3JwI11zlFTG1ps2Cc53ANlQ2lKAYFIf5mrkvOrJKSIvbpTLz6oiqrPGf-sh0ApMWtAiszpMTQjUi1W4vrzhfkyjpwkRyczdwh6dgQAWxeTqFmDDP-eDBHqUTNXweuqhz10Rg1eRRaO2_kRFNP8LaOA5Bq_suYrKRbeA7G57Ol1hmsv2XmatkE_hiDosEeN6cJfKiz47cek4dZA3Va18G3Ea5Kpjo5O5DhsYdzK5ixY3i-LUrUGY=w1421-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cAoFNKE7LsVRC84dXyopwNb2XezVXNLj1hMMQ3ZrbgchaPTTU4dpNVDLKwZxFibAL_SzShILX-uJvEDLECDVQNwQ2KHFQxmLlbyNYvY_t4zzp51clrEMfxFAROWjyEweRgoEl-Y2oWk7q_tHlsMt36JA85yRSOSSBdRvqDML-VC_47f6nABgl_6Vm_36KmX6tKJlmapIb00id_4a5tVWJzOP8pvStXRNbO7uGDuz54S2zOxzQsvgALV22dxAIsytZe0Nwk8wQ6gWykqRhQLIjnCYW6ZwKl3jvKKeag1QR6X_PSITDWckumzvYGaYOtr8Ic34p91ZsSf12ZxIrQ-T2xHjc2mIf4FOWBKzR2cbj6wQYnI5YF9nRk0CF0ItdAoBLddwmGrLqlNygXui06wYVPVJddow5pXC8nKqSLHju9MqBh1I6UjTu10-R1wJn0Uma_2WuCf6E3Tl3l2BW44Uyk5iixYLNfVtS8RO3hLVoLr9s7xcYgHBPl02XduYkI7g0fUP0IrZT8H_nQVddm3d3zZiOs2xTF6a3rd8kSMwafI=w278-h156-no'),
(4, 'Mars', 2, 3389.5, 'Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.\r\n\r\n<p>Until the first successful Mars flyby in 1965 by Mariner 4, many speculated about the presence of liquid water on the planet''s surface. This was based on observed periodic variations in light and dark patches, particularly in the polar latitudes, which appeared to be seas and continents; long, dark striations were interpreted by some as irrigation channels for liquid water. These straight line features were later explained as optical illusions, though geological evidence gathered by unmanned missions suggests that Mars once had large-scale water coverage on its surface at some earlier stage of its life. In 2005, radar data revealed the presence of large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes. The Mars rover Spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in March 2007. The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on July 31, 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mars is host to seven functioning spacecraft: five in orbit—2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN and Mars Orbiter Mission—and two on the surface—Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity and the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity. Defunct spacecraft on the surface include MER-A Spirit and several other inert landers and rovers such as the Phoenix lander, which completed its mission in 2008. Observations by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have revealed possible flowing water during the warmest months on Mars. In 2013, NASA''s Curiosity rover discovered that Mars''s soil contains between 1.5% and 3% water by mass (about two pints of water per cubic foot or 33 liters per cubic meter, albeit attached to other compounds and thus not freely accessible).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitude reaches −2.91, which is surpassed only by Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, and the Sun. Optical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about 300 kilometers (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth''s atmosphere.</p>', 210, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dJTsK1WHO9gy7YsrQOwiVBd02an3AWlEgaC5T6fuxYc4sow9nWVOmnT1eF3k6NljPvyF8y5-N4Lq_o-ptKoEBWJ8FV92oukXykwsRvO39SVN2aAEa7SR1LwtOTe9Q91Pw16F8Qim1Vxe7mZa-aQhXkspETkY7-JaKAgOZZCvsIassuhZY95KGfiPLrQ9uATyoa_qqKaLG8RKIL6yGvhCrZC_zi6CS0ZZJDmeYSDG_pGhzS4Xg2kArfdtuQPYIA6ek4sDAJwKWh_AkdMfJMdtxVITti_xf7M1JN16sb0lAkJpn299cs8BgAgmaNJKlrccDULVL_jj-cUJoQZJWT8wgl1Oyvbwnucfl11CGPD1KqSt1C2zMiN_kHlFSSLCG4a-_qDKMLF2bdIJTUazJU8EhnXhMQ0ZxokgKsP5I6ilnIMrUbfld6qSqIj8KYpp4d6z1ra5OqEWEDzAHZ3s7ksJ2kCeW8WQ2_t2zcb7i3ggi15TkcNWGm_GQR0bPzskhgKG3sWZpXcVAIvIDlEtDiAEk80ja1WvSs5kZq0pjS2Sk5Y=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A1j8K5wZWP6gy4UQeLWVPFlpTQwjD-H1LlhnPQj8nraNT0MJgPx3ybgYO9AiIxC6U4XVz4v3CnwFgn0pxkIP6W-xleDxpqumBOBeWH6NdxUCofaYRYhD88LO0_hfzZJCgc8rPK713y8K8V7lYHOMV4aGC5-lkmnktAw_ygM2qQZgQL4npZRTQ51R-pwUUGXxPA2Wauy7dQMwG-mmbILGr4x0TuEekk68P47VMo4n2_MnLvJ6q-LXkt45vdEBZqsiSRX7OzQQWM0YaKqvEIJO0ZzQ4nALzwZK65ZVXPDEz7KvJGu7xoZd17w5Azsfdr4VyCjpeqiFINOkrPnZNp-S4_Yx2LwoV2MQthV-kBYFYBL6GAaczaJ6zApKXtK3Nht4k233yAhFhiMNFDW1Jl-ALXmNReJhMffjYDX3_niJfRzjjqVo6nwer5fy9z4G1NBd-iMpgdNpfgmSLoGFXaWcSzZTC3UKechHsScsBe3julcxGOmWBCGHl5M7F4XZ7sI3LyhJyyR-VHE4Pn_2HRI0h7-CbZrQfM_FWt6zuEjONKY=w1024-h576-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BYwHKc4JOiR9AWb_n6X8JISEc8KJjCLKUo7CZoVEwI_Y6KWiO-Vzd0gSJwcnYjvG5ELsUpz6BESCWpxYppkLmr7DQqHZv2mo673vRPCmDvWNZhvzNL6jvndr5s-0bFa5-1QuTyOorz_2ZfN3aai_boaH8SYc602qkV0iy3xEE0AFyNCYTx3sVOgiQvpvdjowZG2lcNGN92LE-z7DpK-OfF8XIvs4qnY3eXVH5j_knMpOqLh2AC-Tk38biR5UHnx7ajNeON4pcchZcWnMTq5iXmFxiemuWyLLjGEAm4uOjdwterCrW3VFzuxXKfU3lOHcupIES8EPQ50EIcGgxQNcXZPgpRzYr4VWlaLFY3cFT_z_LYNzrzZiF6Tjm3g_DaSdBLfeYilsZaRS8uLV4aXzto8g5BSZUsZhF8-o9TyNS6APqfjLWqfY1SulrAz4jEack_igyKaKj9RCPR6CS_C1RKfZAMs03suB435vdAG_grAXiUEPmLiOpqslIsKHrzWfBGr_1Jx_oDOkXHVIkl2_G0s8nvcs-z4eHDx0zIsCiy8=w640-h400-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FaYdVUt4G58kUYosb6mxllEd1AkYCSWP0Stc0fmZ74e05ThMj1vGGZGL22NmoQNDZTeQOu7Vo2l1EP1SGIv67_seb_wid6kp_cFuqpJrdJyiXCR5VJUqy-x1CUhtIeBg1YdnXtHnO2HuiBzh36ibNPf4jD4iw0Atxi35JipZM2yTj1No2EmjvDLVJTOySTQgU5mZkjeVsx_Dcwrk-jEV6h0e2osSTUIfqi5WYCSxOrF9t_YIg2Rl0a2eSwXHA2Lasg7nZovbafsJOLxFv0iEofEp7Fu1jlPc_TzGLF2TotuOOUfxYkJZa0_db1Vt_SRLJxfBX1TwDS5wj1O0Yypwh5r2XTWzFhsQaOffnUsCpAhCxSYviIBQ0NI6TILKW87Wrl67Zggpma3-tW6WdDMGUFFKopa3-nawyvasKFiQ9HRKkCEoVuyJfTvc1-rwvHjCMHZXcTh8uaSKMXcaDSGluI6XRJOSHymnKkqS2xZWprIbonA4iYgxh6BIR7oa1oTjal4yGBb0Fq9JwWtvB_RAT_8RoaHVQ9Fd9iHyHtBfhOs=w1024-h576-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/twqikRV4LBs_WT9hpP8h9bZk1w90B_FGsr6N7BBSyPQE8X2kmy2RHKravWsybqGARTRwGsTtMs8hJSpp2jKM8v5j8znF02-ocruan9_32H7YPZ1DKiGC25Yi3v3pB7dWWxF6tvN030bXzAS8xk9pIfk-Rcy5eXgBCcTnLyzKlIaiY5PLzr3gnbPa7iSM_cMnTtcNXOBHeDlyDWbanPIK7v4TR8U6ZWQj0VC8at9oNMraMjcQtkKY1TqYG8A-cFbFuNoggHDY5wiZnQm-lHh-wQa9iqIpp1me2C3MMrpatwwqXW1-KOyD4BXvFMXetQlzSUJ0F0cYlJ7E1kQh6RyhNCHSBuiOGx8z3tjlYOiRQHJK7ZskUZ9hADqCVwbJaDu-ncGNqjGD1p7L2u6s7F-C7i14Kx91Dyze92bF0a_qexOZotWy8TupO4YrGVwdTRseW21LWJTmgwF1C2eBoWLnefMT_RiDpGQCP8gQkVOR5IsvdwO6v9KqqATzcfSbSaRZ4udZ0fNIwH_8hn3D-z-pyrrzaI5Eb8rJGyoMZAg-e2U=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IB-u6vA5XDvWBE2aH4I885SAmHqOdShCYb6RD8gGc6zM04sNGRH9keNlJSidDCE3sENGOMqm23C25WizF9i7H-eTr4t5giCRgEa9IsHOrif7Fv-pejU4G0Ws1Id-jAEMZHmYgQChSgOnElPWCBYNQue4-eWpH-H2B4VjHGj5dbwgFe-HoIfYAfsGSTfK5fJKHnkyNmvluIkp6gbbYMaQuwhu2RPhFcCNe8p_QD3-CUClluvEiH1ODgN4QejWX1BSSFNykXU-vSogXNKNESm3EPIIHiLwCablsvZZVoPSRbsPC2F-08fgcH1munpq026sBZrViXJiMap6YlB7k5WdXH4pQM3hMcnRzgdqhDHAkpesH1u93BKOyCJrNO-9H2ut0hKrZ_9IS_USNzCsnsr33lRIi3SLznazPCoM5dPi3V93z3s4esSE20bogGLYooGJEwbK8giMaswbgVV0-90jfO63fEPan9SWJV45ejMLTlzr8J-e6o3dTDXzu5sCVJdROyHtTACw3hCK7DSuJ-o7d-ia6th3nXmyiW8gLte_6zc=w278-h156-no'),
(5, 'Jupiter', 67, 68911, 'Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth of that of the Sun, but is two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn (Uranus and Neptune are ice giants). Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94, bright enough to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.\r\n\r\n<p>Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, although helium only comprises about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet''s shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 67 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. The most recent probe to visit Jupiter was the Pluto-bound New Horizons spacecraft in late February 2007. The probe used the gravity from Jupiter to increase its speed. Future targets for exploration in the Jovian system include the possible ice-covered liquid ocean on the moon Europa.</p>', 165, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JIGIMS28ED_hrBGeGNGbp5kmV31NKekpL5juS1XKI2cEfup7WLLE3V4Zr15odmAf5J9zafaUHRH0QI0wF5euBfSyjmVzFUdstJG4Y2FcsYjZrGgxn5TiD1IGPO4IHsiVX1lqPUa7Yl8EXHBth6zwOwJCoAN4FmWmSP_HBgo7ZMK4CQpC_zofHc-XtDkf1Ol9KNk2rO2eSmn68bMcyN8TftaoRPOx4nQ7Fm9K_KuFiYaqw4tnR-Jo56GClAqkYyHgmCy8Qk4eMSIm4P0nicEK0oXdqV2gL_IF7vIPUwHk1DpJZd5N9eewHM0RMYK2dJWqjZ17uj1g5pORQGwv-3mMI7Atpvfmkjg3IDtiuX97LmWOOIkOQElrzrKq1VAqn63AFZmSWoMB5ghpEQFjFPzdaaPuZm5ANZqZb5Ig-ZqV31Yb0MEzLKRrBi5gU0zQa8TTl2wmts6q1VQ0SBbC1FY9Z_7w4eMhYRIBzNHyF7nfM4K_5NCuJU9NKFDpxIBo4y3UxZE901oOemJtKigHozKrJYuNELoWDh10TqrhcoSxvAI=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sMrGLqFP842CnNzF_7W7f8pQEB-KyrpHuiSBeNglmCaeSl4ZROmxkVWIXissrZdCAWtpzJ7sm1KFBVyX20z6Ae-3ccql6TOhAjK9U3KyJbVRQGeJNh5ldOJ96JU_Yy06ubvMb3iBKc9mrjXxXm5JzMlPr-nZIY4rcTtwIogFqyIc0aCHYrA6tO9RNyX9V3VnK3gqGZ2XDcP2ndR8UMKFMTdpNIVI_NJ8AMK4DhocDE3TyORViA0GXWnVk3gulfK1l1JX6pdIsk-qIQcrPZbgHLMrdfv11t0ZeRH_t0tw-iy7HsMdem894P_1tytHahGt-nDoLgSFq3ZS4-CzLoe4k-PvdIzPBcQ6QkuT0A9ZDTc7x8khqQLLyfUS-3sg7BuV6_uneycZdgNfbTQ9HcnAg_7S08pdoVN1zrlOIslZgaqZgDDwv_p0CiMtV_TtZwsG8k6BY0nW_wdCftNzQr9hxCChTiCk8JXATRmqere2zZgF1bB-ZwnNrq9xMD7Aimdaniaa5FsSECPW47kNDixKomuwrIBIbu4KvYZQKOzSSwU=w640-h530-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Qq0M8_Xz_ZtUC5AuErtUDEG1oVnstW1ouAwXUfNSr_bZnduIzcvq0G3mDyfn-WZpB2WRGLGjJbucJ-VnmuUM_3zoyjawce8E8LPZxbdfglczFMTai2Aj82fppD7Gs1b3QoDfvRgWdHdDdWvKyLIDOX1Roeg2hjJxf2GvD9Ee0RIoJXTJ9qXeiuF4qj-8VOwLqDrV4CjdLNeIYG-No2ejPwbM7f1Dnpn_84oHkmh7qe04PYXY0-xevCliaFadvAWMJ3WZwH9_bNLNbUUnm6UVJK3Riy8Fu5mwhe6EjcJ7mfnKMUwH7QDJdSs42RvtmpZEMH9XHIpch2TxxZ_C8V1Ia4E-OSXUIn2x4r4dRkz0S8x31WnJDx3Q-NIbpsZXvI5zVvQynb2ocZBFZS2yJ0k2FHZaof6kGCSLS53UrCtvwMnzgOL5eoeCI2okP_hjmXg3EnGF68diwF8PDPnaaU-BIjl_1OweUayKBgbP2ZafZmR-xup3_7glT69NrG-qVmmmMULG6L90nOhltjlczl7El-mhk_IIpeyJXQtYeoSSVNY=w1421-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sjf-FVd35BrJkTTP_nAmHC-eBcTXziOufGjcJB_yiGaxdUN1Q0llpL5RW7kewiofhpnJjx29-XYPf-oAdP5_zz5_OEkXoIlaRCak3YLImJo13AGLrvWIWsEHSjwx_4dnCOWk2zogMwEmoMdJUbqWupVuQADe9zl0P3zEduCVvcDEXycFcbD3G2F4kGl8Tdgy9fxyq6z0L22rrSd4YBFqEmTK6kwWTJHeK2I68i11Wytsi3Ptr3peziebcjgDfX3DAAyz09JydLoAZFimEpHySU62D62h_P-QdI3DMdlGCBy-MVaam482-2fZpPWmqp7JMod01r36wgNxvQspRtvK3SRz0kEDHbQys2Z9N-AOkOdKxNfTZeG3qLXrz98Yuh8rSkJCTUidPrwp-2h3-F8FWezYEAI6PSpD_-Xf99UmqBdfofLPmX3OyRv0szsjORIxd-A-xsyOzU2-6R_ndhm6wX_jssxOzfrrFN8slddJyLErBoPYRVeytX5VrAzBNoIps0qaoFKhK4NNyakHBZcy0vzhp_xzJb23o4OY-Wpnr2c=w800-h600-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ukbKtVES9oY_pPmze2hlelaPGgiffSdG75KjEJFu2mCrWNJwN8EiNjdamux1dOwDvmkjrIRUQzXhQy6cleCbb7bZVh_i-KI26pBJ9seAqdofJLR_3gPXNPfBys2J2WX_aMfM8scgtWbtkeiRGXLesXtqZfzPACe3GembQsAcDrUadNsDnS69JO3ZLYWwV9eqwGUxJPakQUHfE0bveo5OZnHndpJaERLVn7SOyfcKnS3Ot2Q4AdIF0vBPUTNZlzUtE2my0eSW_Y3P6yMMfo7aG-bdBAVUJhpCQHM3iGfgZh1pic_wJfH1XgCDL05xY7f7DRe4bO9LpzS4djn8CVWQEwJTz-gQdFKvuvroOW0ofPwdsM4BTzkDSpr1_f-4_ZZVsepXNrC_Y8tZTuqP9nMT1jLjqKKHleAiVFfX-3floV6aQt1jCJ0nrIm3uPkaRfOa6Gdln-7du0O5qRISXkMRrd_a3iq7k8b1qkvrlDo_0POPDOzeRJJlmrF4yh4gHS18JhigBZsH0AcE_hFvVYHEPmHS56JoiVjLTCZVKQCzU0=w1421-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/H4usawCtsnTYg_rIBnQbzdkPU68ox0rakeenebn7jTlK04PbwhRGhMqlG-OYuRQcdusUjkIVQBU9HYN_0TyzlUMjXyo2ncb1PTW7umq1i9xdrpZB9_3_P7u4jgBKccTZ_jgppk02miHo84SP3cQ6HFHJ5UJyKLeIMvSI0Mop6c28TEvEYR1fg7ATqphe1rapqj86LUNovwvqVawMXyWGiPBKQCiHpky3sd_R95R14KBTHIdX7hAB5yNdgym2tE9au39BcQoolCQKxrat82KqZU-MSni7CqRC6rn8DRQ8niJosr4kW2fNklmzvd-ZmTqGY_d6N3qhDuekyBNIUSh-5ckWFQDHqqkJrw4mMfw3Ae6PWI5t-txroXAVSQtsDlpNewZ4HvVxxAfanIyj19cfZQwtqX_btpbbp3OhBLlGZUChPHBQ5v0NzHZeWMn5UzZRu4iU7OSOD7ebm991SeZ9T-mSTgSj5xebFmO7U2J-fxzzxMYJiYpqQMAcVso07cK3_vrVDKf8sCGHkM7vdq5Dk7QYrZsDZsgYLY4k7-_9qJQ=w278-h156-no'),
(6, 'Saturn', 62, 58232, 'Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture, its astronomical symbol represents the god''s sickle.\r\n\r\n<p>Saturn''s interior is probably composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally outside the Frenkel line a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn''s planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth''s, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn''s larger size. Saturn''s magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth the strength of Jupiter''s. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs and that is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. Sixty-two moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which fifty-three are officially named. This does not include the hundreds of moonlets comprising the rings.

(7, 'Uranus', 27, 25362, 'Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Therefore, astronomers increasingly place them in a separate category called "ice giants". Uranus''s atmosphere, although similar to Jupiter''s and Saturn''s in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, contains more "ices", such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224.2 °C), and has a complex, layered cloud structure, with water thought to make up the lowest clouds, and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.\r\n\r\n<p>Uranus is the only planet whose name is derived from a figure from Greek mythology, from the Latinized version of the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos. Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration among those of the planets because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its revolution about the Sun. Its north and south poles therefore lie where most other planets have their equators. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets. Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. The wind speeds on Uranus can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h, 560 mph).</p>', 76, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/16MBkTIItnOlnESLtJWFwI1fLfzxji5PzYFmEGYYmvmt_JvCGpEH6TSFt8n303HBXXFqvlmM9P1DH5Ckkh1Rqv25jt5V_f_me49pUFMVdceT67W_608kFZ5BAwR8gENnZMswdVxNKH0QV6JkCtU0uUAStFS4hfZ6G3q9ybR95gYbxoAtjASbKG730SWPbSiBH_IcUPIYu95n29-Oy-FpF_OG7kIK0Xdw1Br7toxc12m0PKJ3wjNiaPHEjud52bq7pvLb_YH0B_lUbN2zfIq8h0isiojuxakJqWd0F-RLkTY8gqW_wF7tUGB9ZRsXpaadjFvH_vzzfTCIqhyedCALrMidshAWV7tE3v0J-RQRLz4M7N5f42wy-ChZ-HhUrbsZAOeBmN2jEcT-eKThIAEMeG7CD1A9wnqXBDOndn-jF7W16VZs-HyUgvIlbsO_NAJwUm6bbBeyDuZuepYo6RVBoRUqYY3_sHM5U9nZRmWlZO-g7_pfAZXESswXaKYjqvAYDFdUoLYog4VNKPsVOaG3ts5tQNC8aSXEjcALsG5dGUo=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0I99V3Xe7wBozR-trHi8ghEQCFFD7yr4VK-WdODZ5mNyVY7JdjVhmLXGSySnAlzHZCOQTqETgyIqTyq60cEXF8Y7GsTjFkE6Dg7sYBCwVKgKNlD-Qh95h0CsjaktI76shcF1U8UmH-t3zCfKy1fN9M81x0aZkznJyjqoFXDgI6MjZqmBaDpjRKbNlzlZ5QNk-o-V8uyE82MxY-9U_Z5mAmFU2vwSUH6U79UbY5mUqBYnpGqWoIerAK25NJ_rb2-ziuQjQF0wk73wrfVIVjSrL344TAPY9OFKIXzEUM9WL4OSE3wwn_vq4GNDO3RO4LtJ9ruMh2XJXuNaO5RkxqcfmISKUtnLmqeM3mKZQrJHFeyyxx8dw8pERjV8kX2EL_YrnrrIaDmLGyRILo-IJlyuZAmV9UcsZB-DM33EmgKVJ4LfL9nnZXteaOcvPpj8Qfw-Qf6voRNtafgEXJum-LK0mlsEDJUhG_FAaR-JCLZb8sDZewGYZN7EVMs88L1gphLSOWg6aO-FGKQWLpaH4cY-qytbDR6oi7B-nyo7Jg1tGbM=w800-h600-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P5aruju0uwdnacgz0na9bBPzkNUQfSUrojGPguTNjo5dDvFk7_RJKavkPuuU0iUEbx7GRfjJBQ34IEKAqbbYxHcl76__PeMfPf8OkuSy17FQmd0oKQCBuI4ktn6ShvcRQBM11PbT5c5Em26IpwCfXaKAMcSna92OMgi1079gyrhRxj4rWXsnVUhx1O9MrEqsQeFKyt21AtOs0Fa5obIuD4nfc3-zdWf7ZFHod3QeiRKGGvkT0luD_d2ERS6cKz-A2eD1AAxNWr2JRTVa_kMq8yW0-0K9oapWeSCfMcILnyMWs8ioepSsvlliPWYvNwxSlV0-DE3ItiXrHdD5dJDuN6vGIJmauOnk7zsBQKstgWv0CfrE7CnOJw-jDwHh8XOif6a1rphIGqGV0jcuQnQPcOnuGGGeblXhqqtX3Ik2vxoBPrhFYf29hZ6hWkSrjC9bVPI3En1htgrD4jYY4IuBmfVm2Vp5okZ6kZ1Z1pg-hGfjew2pp3uAXDPV4JezDSWB5K3AZhI0Ogahk0mDLEMZ6xrnfYtDNENVOEE_nQJ290M=w1000-h744-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MAhby444-ne9rijbeyujJTVj1vN3RwdZfO6DdFGNvCq-lIo7nttHszGBD8CGfcZp2S-DVGwhSs1NWus60VQC69Al285t82iLj030XhbLVBR8p5RyjlvUnxxPVzqm2b10uTz0A26ADcMBUU6jqizzkokp-BQppicc5jc2V4UDIjUZp3J99a9ZIIMQeeRs2JgZlzbVdo8DlCOMnnFN_DjKw1gRN9sQCdUqned6IQFPhi39S3DI5n1ftjo2xpTzjp1uVP-pCHeQYVwz2m4DctFfZt0YN1UUYfVx_dGeZqucn8ulVkUPvC_ha5zxYrAty9lS35MOoeo2PUdl4ccmeBfztzSl4Fw12BXuhFH5hcZ8S-OPlj7DVdxDbkz5E_ZaINb7uOgbsHQgoAeJCJOscKfj8cre3s-GhP8NRlmOJmXKMr7yWkH9_Jq0mg_pqmLtKjySA7p8zayk7mpeD1rbVJNWZARs-79NM7Z2ofHUleJlsy0GGYZ0UAXveNBO0F60WTycm3cNQMhorR6HqLS6-nEfIBowq9oriHbz1NYjYf0aFxQ=w800-h500-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPzKVXUJ2V8UTDjHA9L_C31_4sUsHfqrfnzxeqIUEBDWLg4Db5iuZ0hk2purOcZDGMhXmlSyrJSt8UF2y3GhEIjGHaf2mPu6FYeuzFYiekOQpdxkUwkny0DsYS1xy5sebVfWDs2wrIKQNknCjkDR71fXuRdRHLXerG1oSZjIwk6JWaJc89kRJkaK57C864OmZ55kyq8TOZFmoh5xscvnaQ1lHkNhzXdWkdl4gg6dI9c0VXUgQ6DhALgdHKpVmyPNpdStdW7nNS1_eSowqA6Z33tPDGIEcCnGiSmTw3nYuaY2RqIjdbZpbihdhPl-cF6FCq8tYANwrib9qIJ4Nvl0ZZrfgAFzr7GIkGCi_YmV28xAcnbYNput1fxNPaqbeZcjNIqFVdFoqaJM4ESbskquDuHj6lAxpG1RAUxSRQsAiHNQNotfUZC_SM9aGjtabrhNSh1or6_4M77ojq2R0Jx99vVc2v2XYjrPe9Xn615YxwVt9AevbqBA6cQZkHOG2xdIXi6_1sCsD6XGYBYRA0xsgK8DOL7dxoyH7ZEdRcUyGCE=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hyDEu2w6HMQVwWvXHsL9zDbo1gdwfC-z8IATtZl-xF8cTgN7rnfNcMCyCXu60VzI3nYlUqhX9L821nPTwM5HiDex5F0aRQR-ZqQN5CGJGZdgduboyNNM4gvBFC5lwZXaTwQ2Ibqyn1XoVy3ngrS7HVwz_TmL4o4rixI2dl2fMkN0BPoN969shlSsfy0oXTYLe4i8q_aMi6R156NmQ_qCoe23ZuQcfsGpuktPDNtawY31rcupn5xTt-swuBgFJZUwmA23EckYZ1-dNHSE0_mJPhIiIM7RSmlQrNo9E7RLSDd7PCIG2hluwtyykMJu9Opm6uwTYU8oKTfTzvxspQnIa_2dG7FMcTCrsqBhi1C0FXgoF6L0-85z6atgS83jPxbkM-J1Gax_jPf8jhUnhE548KBfH4xjbz8LjxwjojN6_-3IPAQu6QPAQDWUiEOUdIC0k5ZFlzTmBy3Fh2-o5xYo9Dh7tqyJMoAsNcW8YI0Q4hyGdlSnBnUz9QbTIVXijQ1DBiDRUUeZ09kppW8aIgsj5VQC_m0odya5Vj_tpn3n5og=w278-h156-no'),
(8, 'Neptune', 14, 24622, 'Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Among the gaseous planets in the Solar System, Neptune is the most dense. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth, and not as dense as Neptune. Neptune orbits the Sun at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.50×10<sup>9</sup> km). Named after the Roman god of the sea, its astronomical symbol is ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune''s trident.\r\n\r\n<p>Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and was the first and only planet found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet''s remaining 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet''s distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. The advent of Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has allowed for more-detailed observations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neptune is similar in composition to Uranus, and both have compositions that differ from those of the larger gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Neptune''s atmosphere, like Jupiter''s and Saturn''s, is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen; it contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane. Astronomers sometimes categorise Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to emphasise this distinction. The interior of Neptune, like that of Uranus, is primarily composed of ices and rock. Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet''s blue appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune''s atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the 1989 Voyager 2 flyby, the planet''s southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 kilometres per hour (580 m/s; 1,300 mph). Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune''s outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C).

At the time of its discovery, it was the known exoplanet most similar to Earth in terms of mass, radius and mean density.</p>\r\n<p>The planet was discovered in 2013 by analyzing data from Kepler space telescope. The planet was found not only transiting the star, but its occultation and reflected light from the parent star due to orbital phases were also detected. It did not have Kepler object of interest designation at first as the automatic data analysis missed this planet due to its short period.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-78b is 69% more massive than Earth and 20% larger. Two independent teams were involved in pioneering work to estimate the mass of the planet. The estimates were made possible because Kepler-78b''s gravity causes a "wobble" in the orbit of the host star. While the method has been used to characterize gas giants, ordinarily it is hard to estimate the mass of Earth-sized exoplanets because their gravity is too weak to produce a visible influence on their stars. In this case, the planet''s orbit is so close to its star that its gravitational influence has a detectable effect.</p>\r\n<p>One team, led by Francesco Pepe, used the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher-North (HARPS-N) spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in the Canary Islands to estimate that the planet has a mass 1.86 times that of the Earth and a radius 1.16 times. The other, led by Andrew Howard of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, used data from the High Resolution Eschelle Spectrometer on the Keck 1 Telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to estimate the mass as 1.69 times that of the Earth and the radius as 1.2 times. Both estimates put the planet''s density at about 5.5 grams per cubic centimetre, equivalent to that of the Earth and possibly indicative of a rock-iron composition like Earth''s. The iron core could build up to 40% of the planet mass.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-78b is most similar to larger high-density, hot exoplanets like Kepler-10b, Kepler-36b and CoRoT-7b.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-78b orbits around the parent star in an 8.5-hour orbit. It reflects 20% to 60% of the starlight it receives.

This temperature is high enough to have stripped the planet of any stable atmosphere, but the liquid and solid portions of the planet should be stable. According to Francesco Pepe, one of the astronomers involved with the discovery, the planet may be Earth-sized but "it can be imagined like a lava planet rather than an Earth-like planet."</p>\r\n<p>The acceleration of gravity on the planet surface is estimated to be ~11 m/s<sup>2</sup>, slightly larger than Earth''s.\r\n<p>According to CFA astronomer Dimitar Sasselov, "this lava world is an abomination.

Kepler-10 was targeted by NASA''s Kepler spacecraft, as it was seen as the first star identified by the Kepler mission that could be a possible host to a small, transiting exoplanet. The star is slightly less massive, slightly larger, and slightly cooler than the Sun; at an estimated 10.4 billion years in age, Kepler-10 is almost 2.6 times the age of the Sun. Kepler-10 is host to a planetary system made up of at least two planets. Kepler-10b, the first undeniably rocky planet, was discovered in its orbit after eight months of observation and announced on January 10, 2011. The planet orbits its star closely, completing an orbit every 0.8 days, and has a density similar to that of iron. The second planet, Kepler-10c, was confirmed on May 23, 2011, based on follow-up observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The data shows it has an orbital period of 42.3 days and has a radius more than double that of Earth, but a higher density, making it the largest and most massive rocky planet discovered as of June 2014.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-10 was named because it was the tenth planetary system observed by the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA satellite designed to search for Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in front of, their host stars with respect to Earth. The transit slightly dims the host star; this periodic dimming effect is then noted by Kepler. After eight months of observation ranging from May 2009 to January 2010, the Kepler team established Kepler-10b as the first rocky exoplanet discovered by the Kepler satellite. Kepler-10 was the first Kepler-targeted star suspected of having a small planet in orbit. Because of that, verifying Kepler''s discovery was prioritized by telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The discovery was successfully verified. Although there had been many potentially rocky exoplanets discovered in the past, Kepler-10b was the first definitively rocky planet to have been discovered.</p>\r\n<p>The discovery of Kepler-10b was announced to the public at a winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 10, 2011 in Seattle. On May 23, 2011, the existence of Kepler-10c was confirmed at the 218th AAS meeting in Boston.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-10 is a G-type star, like the Sun. With a mass of 0.895 (± 0.06) Msun and a radius of 1.056 (± 0.021) Rsun, the star is approximately 10% smaller than and 5% wider than the Sun. The metallicity of Kepler-10, as measured in [Fe/H] (the amount of iron in the star), is -0.15 (± 0.04); this means that Kepler-10 is about 70% as metal-rich as the Sun. Metallicity tends to play a large role in the formation of planets, determining if they form, and what kind of planet they will form. In addition, Kepler-10 is estimated to be 11.9 billion years old and to have an effective temperature of 5627 (± 44) K; To compare, the Sun is younger and hotter, with an age of 4.6 billion years and an effective temperature of 5778 K.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-10 is located at a distance of 173 (± 27) parsecs from the Earth, which equates to approximately 564 light years. Also, Kepler-10''s apparent magnitude, or brightness as seen from Earth, is 10.96; it therefore cannot be seen with the naked eye.</p>\r\n<p>Per the usual exoplanet nomenclature, the first planet discovered to be orbiting Kepler-10 is called Kepler-10b. Announced in 2011, it was the first rocky planet identified outside the Solar system. The planet has a mass that is 3.33±0.49 times that of Earth''s and a radius that is 1.47<sup>+0.03</sup><sub>−0.02</sub> times that of Earth. The planet orbits Kepler-10 at a distance of 0.01684 AU every 0.8375 days; this can be compared to the orbit and orbital period of planet Mercury, which circles the Sun at a distance of 0.3871 AU every 87.97 days. Because the planet orbits so closely to its star, its eccentricity is virtually zero. It, thus, has an extremely circular orbit.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-10c was also discovered by NASA''s Kepler Mission, the second exoplanet found to orbit Kepler-10. Radial-velocity measurements of the body suggest that it has a mass of 17.2±1.9 Earth masses and a radius of 2.35 Earth radii, making it the largest known rocky planet as of 2014.

The radius of the planet''s orbit is 7 million kilometres, about 0.047 astronomical units, or one eighth the radius of Mercury''s orbit. This small radius results in a year that is 3.5 Earth days long and an estimated surface temperature of about 1,000 °C (about 1,800 °F). Its mass is 220 times that of Earth (0.69 Jupiter masses) and its volume is some 2.5 times greater than that of Jupiter.

Astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope that they might observe a dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star''s face. This would require the planet''s orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after the discovery, separate teams, one led by David Charbonneau including Timothy Brown and others, and the other by Gregory W. Henry, were able to detect a transit of the planet across the surface of the star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet. On September 9 and 16, 1999, Charbonneau''s team measured a 1.7% drop in HD 209458''s brightness, which was attributed to the passage of the planet across the star. On November 8, Henry''s team observed a partial transit, seeing only the ingress. Initially unsure of their results, the Henry group decided to rush their results to publication after overhearing rumors that Charbonneau had successfully seen an entire transit in September. Papers from both teams were published simultaneously in the same issue of the Astrophysical Journal. Each transit lasts about three hours, during which the planet covers about 1.5% of the star''s face.</p>\r\n<p>The star had been observed many times by the Hipparcos satellite, which allowed astronomers to calculate the orbital period of HD 209458 b very accurately at 3.524736 days.</p>\r\nSpectroscopic analysis had shown that the planet had a mass about 0.69 times that of Jupiter. The occurrence of transits allowed astronomers to calculate the planet''s radius, which had not been possible for any previously known exoplanet, and it turned out to have a radius some 35% larger than Jupiter''s.\r\nOn March 22, 2005, NASA released news that infrared light from the planet had been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet. This was done by subtracting the parent star''s constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited in front of the star and was eclipsed behind it, providing a measure of the light from the planet itself. New measurements from this observation determined the planet''s temperature as at least 750 °C (1300 °F). The circular orbit of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.\r\nOn February 21, 2007, NASA and Nature released news that HD 209458 b was one of the first two extrasolar planets to have their spectra directly observed, the other one being HD 189733 b. This was long seen as the first mechanism by which extrasolar but non-sentient life forms could be searched for, by way of influence on a planet''s atmosphere. A group of investigators led by Jeremy Richardson of NASA''s Goddard Space Flight Center spectrally measured HD 209458 b''s atmosphere in the range of 7.5 to 13.2 micrometres. The results defied theoretical expectations in several ways. The spectrum had been predicted to have a peak at 10 micrometres which would have indicated water vapor in the atmosphere, but such a peak was absent, indicating no detectable water vapor. Another unpredicted peak was observed at 9.65 micrometres, which the investigators attributed to clouds of silicate dust, a phenomenon not previously observed. Another unpredicted peak occurred at 7.78 micrometres, which the investigators did not have an explanation for. A separate team led by Mark Swain of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory reanalyzed the Richardson et al. data, and had not yet published their results when the Richardson et al. article came out, but made similar findings.</p>\r\n<p>On 23 June 2010, astronomers announced they have measured a superstorm (with windspeeds of up to 7000 km/h) for the first time in the atmosphere of HD 209458 b. The very high-precision observations done by ESO’s Very Large Telescope and its powerful CRIRES spectrograph of carbon monoxide gas show that it is streaming at enormous speed from the extremely hot day side to the cooler night side of the planet. The observations also allow another exciting “first”—measuring the orbital speed of the exoplanet itself, providing a direct determination of its mass.\r\nAs of August 2008, the most recent calculation of HD 209458 b''s Rossiter–McLaughlin effect and so spin-orbit angle was that of Winn in 2005. This is −4.4 ± 1.4 degrees.\r\nIt had been previously hypothesized that hot Jupiters particularly close to their parent star should exhibit this kind of inflation due to intense heating of their outer atmosphere. Tidal heating due to its orbit''s eccentricity, which may have been more eccentric at formation, may also have played a role over the past billion years.\r\nThe atmosphere is at a pressure of one bar at an altitude of 1.29 Jupiter radii above the planet''s center.</p>\r\n<p>Where the pressure is 33±5 millibars, the atmosphere is clear (probably hydrogen) and its Rayleigh effect is detectable. At that pressure the temperature is 2200±260 K.</p>\r\n<p>Observations by the orbiting Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope initially limited the planet''s albedo (or reflectivity) below 30%, making it a surprisingly dark object. (The geometric albedo has since been measured to 3.8 ± 4.5%.) In comparison, Jupiter has a much higher albedo of 52%. This would suggest that HD 209458 b''s upper cloud deck is either made of less reflective material than is Jupiter''s, or else has no clouds and Rayleigh-scatters incoming radiation like Earth''s dark ocean. Models since then have shown that between the top of its atmosphere and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, there exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. This implies an outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud; usually thought to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides like M dwarf stars ("pM planets"), but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The Rayleigh-scattering heated hydrogen rests at the top of the stratosphere; the absorptive portion of the cloud deck floats above it at 25 millibars.\r\nSurrounding that level, on November 27, 2001 the Hubble Space Telescope detected sodium, the first planetary atmosphere outside the Solar System to be measured. This detection was predicted by Sara Seager in late 2001. The core of the sodium line runs from pressures of 50 millibar to a microbar. This turns out to be about a third the amount of sodium at HD 189733 b.</p>\r\n<p>In 2003–4, astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to discover an enormous ellipsoidal envelope of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen around the planet that reaches 10,000 K. The hydrogen exosphere extends to a distance R<sub>H</sub>=3.1 R<sub>J</sub>, much larger than the planetary radius of 1.32 R<sub>J</sub>. At this temperature and distance, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of particle velocities gives rise to a significant ''tail'' of atoms moving at speeds greater than the escape velocity. The planet is estimated to be losing about 100–500 million (1–5×10<sup>8</sup>) kg of hydrogen per second. Analysis of the starlight passing through the envelope shows that the heavier carbon and oxygen atoms are being blown from the planet by the extreme "hydrodynamic drag" created by its evaporating hydrogen atmosphere. The hydrogen tail streaming from the planet is approximately 200,000 kilometres long, which is roughly equivalent to its diameter.</p>\r\n<p>It is thought that this type of atmosphere loss may be common to all planets orbiting Sun-like stars closer than around 0.1 AU. HD 209458 b will not evaporate entirely, although it may have lost up to about 7% of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5 billion years. It may be possible that the planet''s magnetic field may prevent this loss, as the exosphere would become ionized by the star, and the magnetic field would contain the ions from loss.\r\nOn April 10, 2007, Travis Barman of the Lowell Observatory announced evidence that the atmosphere of HD 209458 b contained water vapor. Using a combination of previously published Hubble Space Telescope measurements and new theoretical models, Barman found strong evidence for water absorption in the planet''s atmosphere. His method modeled light passing directly through the atmosphere from the planet''s star as the planet passed in front of it. However, this hypothesis is still being investigated for confirmation.</p>\r\n<p>Barman drew on data and measurements taken by Heather Knutson, a student at Harvard University, from the Hubble Space Telescope, and applied new theoretical models to demonstrate the likelihood of water absorption in the atmosphere of the planet. The planet orbits its parent star every three and a half days, and each time it passes in front of its parent star, the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the atmosphere absorbs light passing from the star directly through the atmosphere in the direction of Earth.</p>\r\n<p>According to a summary of the research, atmospheric water absorption in such an exoplanet renders it larger in appearance across one part of the infrared spectrum, compared to wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Barman took Knutson''s Hubble data on HD 209458 b, applied to his theoretical model, and allegedly identified water absorption in the planet''s atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p>On April 24, the astronomer David Charbonneau, who led the team that made the Hubble observations, cautioned that the telescope itself may have introduced variations that caused the theoretical model to suggest the presence of water. He hoped that further observations would clear the matter up in the following months. As of April 2007, further investigation is being conducted.</p>\r\n<p>On October 20, 2009, researchers at JPL announced the discovery of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane in the atmosphere.\r\nIn 2014, a magnetic field around HD 209458 b was inferred from the way hydrogen was evaporating from the planet. It is the first (indirect) detection of a magnetic field on an exoplanet. The magnetic field is estimated to be about one tenth as strong as Jupiter''s.</p>\r\n', 1130, '/resources/images/planets/osirisplanet.jpg', '', '/resources/images/planets/osiris/osirisMain.jpg', '/resources/images/planets/osiris/osirisSmall.jpg'),
(15, 'HD 189733b', 0, 78420.718, '<p>HD 189733 b is an extrasolar planet approximately 63 light-years away from the Solar System in the constellation of Vulpecula, the Fox. The planet was discovered orbiting the star HD 189733 A on October 5, 2005, when astronomers in France observed the planet transiting across the face of the star. With a mass 13% higher than that of Jupiter, HD 189733 b orbits its host star once every 2.2 days at an orbital speed of 152.5 kilometres per second (341,000 mph), making it a hot Jupiter with poor prospects for life as we know it. Being the closest transiting hot Jupiter to Earth, HD 189733 b is a subject for extensive atmospheric examination. HD 189733 b was the first extrasolar planet for which a thermal map was constructed, to be detected through polarimetry, to have its overall colour determined (deep blue), to have a transit detected in x-ray spectrum and to have carbon dioxide detected in its atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p>In July, 2014, NASA announced finding very dry atmospheres on three exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b) orbiting Sun-like stars.\r\nOn October 6, 2005, a team of astronomers announced the discovery of transiting planet HD 189733 b. The planet was then detected using Doppler spectroscopy. Real-time radial velocity measurements detected the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect caused by the planet passing in front of its star before photometric measurements confirmed that the planet was transiting. In 2006, a team led by Drake Deming announced a detection of strong infrared thermal emission from the transiting extrasolar planet HD 189733 b, by measuring the flux decrement (decrease of total light) during its prominent secondary eclipse (when the planet passes behind the star).</p>\r\n<p>The mass of the planet is estimated to be 13% larger than Jupiter''s, with the planet completing an orbit around its host star every 2.2 days and an orbital speed of 152.5 km/s.\r\nOn February 21, 2007, NASA released news that the Spitzer Space Telescope had measured detailed spectra from both HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b. The release came simultaneously with the public release of a new issue of Nature containing the first publication on the spectroscopic observation of the other exoplanet, HD 209458 b. A paper was submitted and published by the Astrophysical Journal Letters. The spectroscopic observations of HD 189733 b were led by Carl Grillmair of NASA''s Spitzer Science Center.\r\nIn 2008, a team of astrophysicists managed to detect and monitor the planet''s visible light using polarimetry, the first such success. This result was further improved by the same team in 2011. They found that the planet albedo is significantly larger in blue light than in the red, most probably due to Rayleigh scattering and molecular absorption in the red. The blue colour of the planet was subsequently confirmed in 2013, making HD 189733 the first planet to have its overall colour determined by two different techniques.</p>\r\n<p>The blueness of the planet may be the result of Rayleigh scattering. In mid January 2008, spectral observation during the planet''s transit using that model found that if molecular hydrogen exists, it would have an atmospheric pressure of 410 ± 30 mbar of 0.1564 solar radii. The Mie approximation model also found that there is a possible condensate in its atmosphere, magnesium silicate (MgSiO3) with a particle size of approximately 10<sup>−2</sup> to 10<sup>−1</sup> μm. Using both models, the planet''s temperature would be between 1340 to 1540 K. The Rayleigh effect is confirmed in other models, and by the apparent lack of a cooler, shaded stratosphere below its outer atmosphere.\r\nIn July 2013, NASA reported the first observations of planet transit studied in X-ray spectrum. It was found that the planet''s atmosphere blocks three times more x-rays than visible light.\r\nIn March 2010, transit observations using HI Lyman-alpha found that this planet is evaporating at a rate of 1-100 gigagrams per second. This indication was found by detecting the extended exosphere of atomic hydrogen. HD 189733 b is the second planet after HD 209458 b for which atmospheric evaporation has been detected.\r\nThis planet exhibits one of the largest photometric transit depth (amount of the parent star''s light blocked) of extrasolar planets so far observed, approximately 3%. The apparent longitude of ascending node of its orbit is 16 degrees +/- 8 away from north-south in our sky. It and HD 209458 b were the first two planets to be directly spectroscopically observed. The parent stars of these two planets are the brightest transiting-planet host stars, so these planets will continue to receive the most attention by astronomers. Like most hot Jupiters, this planet is thought to be tidally locked to its parent star, meaning it has a permanent day and night.</p>\r\n<p>The planet is not oblate, and has neither satellites with greater than 0.8 the radius of Earth nor a ring system like that of Saturn.</p>\r\n<p>The atmosphere was at first predicted "pL class", lacking a temperature-inversion stratosphere; like L dwarfs which lack titanium and vanadium oxides.Follow-up measurements, tested against a stratospheric model, yielded inconclusive results. Atmospheric condensates form a haze 1000 km above the surface as viewed in the infrared. A sunset viewed from that surface would be red. Sodium and potassium signals were predicted by Tinetti 2007. First obscured by the haze of condensates, sodium was eventually observed at three times the concentration of HD 209458 b''s sodium layer. HD 189733 is also the first extrasolar planet confirmed to have carbon dioxide in its atmosphere.\r\nIn 2007, the Spitzer space telescope was used to map the planet''s temperature emissions. The planet+star system was observed for 33 consecutive hours, starting when only the night side of the planet was in view. Over the course of one-half of the planet''s orbit, more and more of the day side came into view. A temperature range of 973 ± 33 K to 1,212 ± 11 K was discovered, indicating that the absorbed energy from the parent star is distributed fairly evenly through the planet''s atmosphere. Interestingly, the region of peak temperature was offset 30 degrees east of the substellar point, as predicted by theoretical models of hot Jupiters taking into account a parameterized day to night redistribution mechanism.\r\nScientists at the University of Warwick determined that it has winds of up to 8,700 km/h (5,400 mph) blowing from the day side to the night side. NASA released a brightness map of the surface temperature of HD 189733 b; it is the first map ever published of an extra-solar planet.\r\nOn July 11, 2007, a team led by Giovanna Tinetti published the results of their observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope concluding there is solid evidence for significant amounts of water vapor in the planet''s atmosphere. Follow-up observations made using the Hubble Space Telescope confirm the presence of water vapor, neutral oxygen and also the organic compound methane. Later, Very Large Telescope observations also detected the presence of carbon monoxide on the day side of the planet. It is currently unknown how the methane originated as the planet''s high 700 °C temperature should cause the water and methane to react, replacing the atmosphere with carbon monoxide.\r\nWhile transiting the system also clearly exhibits the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, the shifting in photospheric spectral lines caused by the planet occulting a part of the rotating stellar surface. Due to its high mass and close orbit the parent star has a very large semi-amplitude (K), the "wobble" in the star''s radial velocity, of 205 m/s.</p>\r\n<p>The Rossiter–McLaughlin effect allows the measurement of the angle between the planet''s orbital plane and the equatorial plane of the star. These are well aligned. By analogy with HD 149026 b, the formation of the planet was peaceful and probably involved interactions with the protoplanetary disc. A much larger angle would have suggested a violent interplay with other protoplanets.</p>', 1117, '/resources/images/planets/hd189733bplanet.jpg', '', '/resources/images/planets/hd189733b/hd189733bMain.jpg', '/resources/images/planets/hd189733b/hd189733bSmall.jpg'),
(16, 'WASP-12b', 0, 126107.13, '<p>WASP-12b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star WASP-12, discovered by the SuperWASP planetary transit survey. Its discovery was announced on April 1, 2008. Due to its extremely close orbit to its star, it has one of the lowest densities for exoplanets (''inflated'' by the flux of energy from the star). The planet takes only a little over a day to orbit the star, in contrast to 365 days for the Earth to orbit the Sun. Its distance from the star (approximately 2,115,000 miles) is only 1/44 the Earth’s distance from the Sun, with an eccentricity the same as Jupiter''s. On 3 December 2013, scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope reported detecting water in the atmosphere of the exoplanet.</p>\r\n<p>In July, 2014, NASA announced finding very dry atmospheres on three exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b) orbiting sun-like stars.\r\nThe planet is so close to WASP-12 that the star''s tidal forces are distorting it into an egg shape and pulling away its atmosphere at a rate of about 10<sup>−7</sup> M<sub>J</sub> (about 189 quadrillion tonnes) per year. The so-called "tidal heating", and the proximity of the planet to its star, combine to bring the surface temperature to more than 2,500 K (2,200 °C).</p>\r\n<p>On May 20, 2010, the Hubble Space Telescope spotted WASP-12b being "consumed" by its star. Scientists had been aware that stars could consume planets; however, this was the first time such an event had been observed so clearly. NASA has estimated that the planet has 10 million years left of its life.</p>\r\n<p>The Hubble Space Telescope observed the planet by using its Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). The observations have confirmed predictions published in Nature in February 2009 by Peking University''s Shu-lin Li. The planet''s atmosphere has ballooned to be nearly three times the radius of Jupiter, while the planet itself has 40% more mass than Jupiter.\r\nRecent evidence indicates that WASP-12b has an enhanced carbon-to-oxygen ratio, significantly higher than that of the Sun, indicating that it is a carbon-rich gas giant. The C/O ratio compatible with observations is about 1, while the solar value is 0.54. The C/O ratios suggest that carbon-rich planets may have formed in the star system. One of the researchers behind that study commented that "with more carbon than oxygen, you would get rocks of pure carbon, such as diamond or graphite".</p>\r\n<p>The published study states: "Although carbon-rich giant planets like WASP-12b have not been observed, theory predicts myriad compositions for carbon-dominated solid planets. Terrestrial-sized carbon planets, for instance, could be dominated by graphite or diamond interiors, as opposed to the silicate composition of Earth." These remarks have led the media to pick up on the story, some even calling WASP-12b a "diamond planet".</p>\r\n<p>The carbon content of the planet is located within its atmosphere, in the form of carbon monoxide and methane. The study appears in the journal Nature.</p>\r\n', 2525, '/resources/images/planets/wasp12bplanet.jpg', '', '/resources/images/planets/wasp12b/wasp12bMain.jpg', '/resources/images/planets/wasp12b/wasp12bSmall.jpg');

(1, 'Moon', 220, 'The Moon (Latin: Luna) is Earth''s only natural satellite. It is one of the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, and, among planetary satellites, the largest relative to the size of the planet it orbits (its primary). It is the second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known (after Jupiter''s satellite Io).\r\n\r\n<p>The Moon is thought to have formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth. Although there have been several hypotheses for its origin in the past, the current most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. It is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth''s sky (after the Sun), as measured by illuminance on Earth''s surface. Although it can appear a very bright white, its surface is actually dark, with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have, since ancient times, made the Moon an important cultural influence on language, calendars, art, and mythology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Moon''s gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the slight lengthening of the day. The Moon''s current orbital distance is about thirty times the diameter of Earth, causing it to have an apparent size in the sky almost the same as that of the Sun. This allows the Moon to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipse. This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence. The Moon''s linear distance from Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3.82 ± 0.07 centimetres (1.504 ± 0.028 in) per year, but this rate is not constant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Soviet Union''s Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959; the United States'' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date, beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968, and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first being Apollo 11. These missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks, which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the Moon''s origin, the formation of its internal structure, and its subsequent history.

(2, 'Io', 110, 'Io /ˈaɪ.oʊ/ is the innermost of the four Galilean moons of the planet Jupiter. It is the fourth-largest moon, has the highest density of all the moons, and is the driest known object in the Solar System. It was discovered in 1610 and was named after the mythological character Io, a priestess of Hera who became one of Zeus''s lovers.\r\n\r\n<p>With over 400 active volcanoes, Io is the most geologically active object in the Solar System. This extreme geologic activity is the result of tidal heating from friction generated within Io''s interior as it is pulled between Jupiter and the other Galilean satellites—Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Several volcanoes produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that climb as high as 500 km (300 mi) above the surface. Io''s surface is also dotted with more than 100 mountains that have been uplifted by extensive compression at the base of Io''s silicate crust. Some of these peaks are taller than Mount Everest. Unlike most satellites in the outer Solar System, which are mostly composed of water ice, Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core. Most of Io''s surface is composed of extensive plains coated with sulfur and sulfur dioxide frost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Io''s volcanism is responsible for many of its unique features. Its volcanic plumes and lava flows produce large surface changes and paint the surface in various subtle shades of yellow, red, white, black, and green, largely due to allotropes and compounds of sulfur. Numerous extensive lava flows, several more than 500 km (300 mi) in length, also mark the surface. The materials produced by this volcanism make up Io''s thin, patchy atmosphere and Jupiter''s extensive magnetosphere. Io''s volcanic ejecta also produce a large plasma torus around Jupiter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Io played a significant role in the development of astronomy in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was discovered in January 1610 by Galileo Galilei, along with the other Galilean satellites. This discovery furthered the adoption of the Copernican model of the Solar System, the development of Kepler''s laws of motion, and the first measurement of the speed of light. From Earth, Io remained just a point of light until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it became possible to resolve its large-scale surface features, such as the dark red polar and bright equatorial regions. In 1979, the two Voyager spacecraft revealed Io to be a geologically active world, with numerous volcanic features, large mountains, and a young surface with no obvious impact craters. The Galileo spacecraft performed several close flybys in the 1990s and early 2000s, obtaining data about Io''s interior structure and surface composition. These spacecraft also revealed the relationship between Io and Jupiter''s magnetosphere and the existence of a belt of high-energy radiation centered on Io''s orbit. Io receives about 3,600 rem (36 Sv) of ionizing radiation per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further observations have been made by Cassini–Huygens in 2000 and New Horizons in 2007, as well as from Earth-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>', 'Jupiter', 1821.6, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BJoAyDeG_EsK8kLkg9CHz68GecQYp4g2kpKod1iUwrrayauZpra4ODP5IDvrUH3RFMCkrgLzPEDoJaYaLjKvsXzu9oU5-vMar0gFD4lA5G9fwQRsChy06AmHLwBspZ1N4ktx-HgLbqLpnxT4GfoiugwCvwqJeYyh82cI237xsdBfQ7fzCZhLLrzByC4XGV-d_LEF12MoUwMr8Bm-9vto0ftVXO8GP6OE7creYlA_1ZBwtOVu-a1qmbv55qGp4IAbP9UvCwXf31NeU8c1wACVBFDL-BmeKZzqfaHEhLS8ingFX5AIhwnzWXInkd7fcWYr-nDg_4JnqjQVqBhwJllRQXgMeHaA8-CiexBILVK9rVmAneBdvRSKyw_XXyNA3MItvMVE_ZoaIDZuolCqAyVqaPHnDSFBay_k58GaDsj6WwuHFK5eD0t2YifKWenBaT7rjXBzye6xBcm1c0U3H7V796XupZ1UBgrd-pDLgI0BppXyRGUWConZy4Wgbn2QJVqcdS8CCBsOIA1OZ5osoN_t2ycWMr6L6IFySdFZ3NeLpsE=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9uZJP9TfopzHL6oQioxkzOP99qZ4wHB_XeHhvfiZ4SU8lt0GyZ6SxghFfjHIOLa5fZjXHsAzLqkwGhIrMEqFZBxZ_JfFhguOaV12-iy5OLbxha5j5W-4ZiVbq6P0bB1zWlB5s1dFuyso8wMRzokiUqM0_s_PpEMjBqaZNVzTWO_5I-jVjgiR-_H3XWcnyKEmhl0pAJR5jL8GCFIE01_7GT-Rw_Wwic-znXviU69pnY-3QZsua7q9ABbKc_4swy0taiJ-_RenuX5UGBKONAmWrdHjvkpKtjF6Eq3vWTXRgyriJcLf_IswG1uRV4-5-zaCC9vUQAa7YREAQxeHl4RgbwXh3PU2-QgkD4wvWBSjoO_L76P1RrMaUU5sInvsKxeF7HZXGjROJf1NLWJiAI9MXiJTvqlnu4Y_MDyJJsJpj4qwBgzGd_YAq7nQSVFwANubnVNkGyc_qT0qLZzz2l6u8bj_7RG8mG7OL2sjm9n6Bmjn4F1NiNdsxtwzcrxzcUu5D0Q3yJQHQygBP3zHRJzEt-cCbzts7kO_B6eM9XWNIGk=w850-h575-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9KDTf2V1KCHUol7dBJ3FIMd-p6g7moWOnMCFDjkhnRyIr0KgUW37evfhDLs08KLLQePjvQwXKhbdTo0761Uc2SCLyMs0U1xAb0O2IEa0ePv87OlL58cXuPPw8DelqjzkNWjhWHZIC3a3XN9SkPAYFGMlsHAFvF-yiIjBfCiyFRhxrwzdEUdXR819D0w-WanDKjaEHIq5SxybLpZT-RxmkzLwS5ADZOMn3FCqrUS5RJ5PCudwVl1JLc-UKPiu1mIFEO2mC01ZVVxuxyHWWLfihkawOfB3Eu03z7NT1ERbBm_nFDr2GQ2HCuEwr9wh_00flyJqdSD_94LMI2f8geGbejoCa9GgA5TwrKtKCfWWONzz6keqyLQ7D8R9Js-qzKXMuAU_msizIucPwundL4zwm77XsBCUbwr3IG8haQ3jJFSdAVR79uFZpv7QMqu4bAO7OImOi0SZKxZEJdjpL05uQz1FKs7idhLFzhF-_Is43oyApKW2v6XNI37b6BjB6TBKtPX4bKtivyG21dVyKue1srerHUJlse4eFYU_zDNYhZ4=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/C65h6k4cXc_JfMRiyd9L7nnLE8A5-WfI1KoFhbSg9AsnnpTwY-F8PQ8GrI1jcEdjgF7_MHRcBAMLfcJSvQ_uzLGGIhGXJj5_RpCbH8lQ6HCbXJlpjVXo5KQw8R3i9cglHzPGs35Gj33FE4H3pKdRQPAcyVCOO8cRNVXNUzfAJKTkDSNpR1KYy2Qm2u5dcdXGB6YGk4kjFSqWAmQcZ28xfTeUMAe3yTUF1u2NCWodRiUk28FmYXzRuXAK8sjsROz2yMq8OFug7MNsPTVSV7WzxYiULErF6H9rQku2YOEuGIdFfwYEtUomDzNtl2V8MUCP8VlGLNKaYOx-YT87KmUUEhux9RZPAha5ghqLykhCqai7e-EBZmaNtWvvK0xstCFyKOG1UPRykxxLppp3DVVGNSjl5SSv72MbI41HKN8WlQ6zDPznxI3PJVkMSKPrJtrAVa5QS_7vDiUjDOJKMby2j-YebXhosYc-iHhJtosAj2D4cv9VgAwMTzgIoExYVKpHL2WcGyVNbypvRmfWYb7NWmYcX46mtRd5qhDeK0BYCAY=w278-h156-no'),
(3, 'Europa', 110, 'Europa /jʊˈroʊpə/ (Jupiter II), is the sixth-closest moon of Jupiter, and the smallest of its four Galilean satellites, but still the sixth-largest moon in the Solar System. Europa was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei[1] and was named after Europa, daughter of the king of Tyre, who became one of Zeus'' lovers. Progressively better observations of Europa have occurred over the centuries by Earth-bound telescopes, and by space probe flybys starting in the 1970s.\r\n\r\n<p>Slightly smaller than the Moon, Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an iron–nickel core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is striated by cracks and streaks, whereas craters are relatively rare. It has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. This hypothesis proposes that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives geological activity similar to plate tectonics. On 8 September 2014, NASA reported finding evidence supporting earlier suggestions of plate tectonics in Europa''s thick ice shell—the first sign of such geological activity on a world other than Earth. On 12 May 2015, scientists announced that sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable for life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2013, NASA reported the detection of "clay-like minerals" (specifically, phyllosilicates), often associated with "organic material" on the icy crust of Europa. In addition, NASA announced, based on studies with the Hubble Space Telescope, that water vapor plumes were detected on Europa and were similar to water vapor plumes detected on Enceladus, moon of Saturn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Galileo mission, launched in 1989, provided the bulk of current data on Europa. No spacecraft has yet landed on Europa, but its intriguing characteristics have led to several ambitious exploration proposals. The European Space Agency''s Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) is a mission to Europa that is due to launch in 2022. NASA''s planned Europa Clipper mission will be launched in the mid-2020s.</p>', 'Jupiter', 1560.8, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/X97Tna9Nlv_UG696DlOdUWxRjiwFjECl0fdmjSO0_xdk4P6bM7vDIToz27WsSk_mBut6VRudfXunux3UeXIBdw8gFbOlEgNkhKzMkv2d6_uRpP2sY7KvczTQM83ti1MtpAoir0i6Tou89_8sfY0C3flEEFwKcFnvTM641s8XrWRyq-QjlVIbm9MuUu11LteYxUSftFcV-1OXlspXvmdnAEmSseoq-Vh-XXLpGhE-z-7aK65HWb9JZezQx7xEf8BMI2UrvwcT6H1QagqGSZlyT51u_xzcre00VeOPzdf1XyCh3UMgr3ZCxn0R-eDFrYf1oQQVg1eSuVCkgvWAkzUMLlk7AEovSu9sPYDk5BKxQE0GpOIAT-VkOIc8CT5mUn0LLhozdNJEz53kyD7fFOvn_wkCWRV8tijfjD4Bg9BzKuYBd_VcUt19mDDJORbWlc2veluykc4ivlUqbwQ1p5AA8lIS9SPjcJU6DHiQqW_U5Z7WQV7Y9v6kLdnq8c7raVwqlSUkSZpWbIkeOGv7S3U-tozvjCPBpr-BhZx0JtHnZ-c=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/c69z3L-Ab5BVi73wTsyuiU6e7JMoiuS6IheV4PO4bHWEdN88yauH-y4Xm7LqddpuXMEH6ywWvDsjHdKv03fBMLRyzaC9rGlht1eEIz1_rKDk4MGGWgCmK4kp_QPIuSDsX2h8fCwLeo_OlsZ8e7yukstPMpCV6azkjThsFggq_x3l_h3kFi_RYIkd5XqxvQ_TJ9MgMLIRL06_GahDWBCOJP1ETg8QXP6ImNTXfO6ObidVbpbOHp7LReHy8ThZ2KAhKxLPM136QOfXcG5m4zh60tdb5EHjhMT24ROcesGqNmhCsbjlNSsruxmpGCn_c9MXflQ_tLQGbHeapLZcc4iHlQ77DFQi7lDERS0E5uloD1Hv7wVjK2Bx3P-VW_TRl-zXKKFcT4cPw6_rOnOJNZ84CAx1gNeiet2eQW3TokHV1hK_AflyBIJuZmF1YqhcTxqeWoaTmJ2IHwNrxTH-mzh19jUuPT_ofsQ42puvN720x-rdms_q2FXPKL0CIICsD2lvYEQUXst7YSboEP-8XXINSkRG1hjy_O20gD9ELSbCp48=w1081-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5H1xB3mFkjvwnVw9Rw66MUFDIeHaTc5OBjzvEc5-Q4OoGJgAJvXskmaXWd-v2phxAD41Jam9sm9Ni4qJBDfwK2D5oRp2mBaHtIctGngmKeSD_P9SStVGSowqLCvP2jywftGr08S_IDwJn7-h29-WCHdA7ZlU-Gu5nxJrOfCQYvSLb2WGp3uOuwBgXdNCYDn0CeIDLXGurlxVUHLZOOIO0V7cnh01HEAZSak9JWtIpr_VVE-Bt3TKEyKkZUgs33gWQwtmZA37cqHsbaj0nxspBZ208F224p8lQFAcQb3q0n1iPU8zmN_GsRK9bkN3ktDL9YhALglleAxAQ8c4TlHlOCmFMBon_Xw3PzdbLFRbs63p7fs7MITkC2-VaJy-Xcbp9vkZlXGoZ-jHmHeZXQpSiZhZ2we0_GvuXtGPuFwnjtwHTNXnttQ6aajoC2M3f5LoNH9S3imS7PVvbZY4X8uvQ1XPtwdA5-VkMuSu146CgUY2duw1K2oS5l2K0SlvC5DCHVN3Mh2kMSyp4jRIWAmuyDDGDanuKFEh4fQEPsq_pfI=w1024-h777-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XOUg7JsfEP5AsUYuroGpd8XUqCXVQys-RykcqA4Ju-axX5OToUl69VrJz8uepzhEgSRbALIRIB0Hi4ro_hTe64yilFtVmQPMj1xtuBv1VpUvqcLh1eGTWHLoM6o3Nuw9XYPFxzAzhm3G8UQFtIId7OZ1Gph0Ohd2OvdU1Yg9rKGnpA9eYSiAoLfURuFb1VbNMYuK3mVmN71LUEWki3lAOJL2VSzUI5XnqXy5EacB1U2Eu-u2XD405MF8f1ccgGhzgKrj3_EwH2Rmy_C5Ur8uKobenat4G-eGAVfXIw3j3WGjK0YxKv8tGTgpfzf_p9VZazkgYV5nSi0PAiohtl3FW99ALtJTin23h-eSnjYqV0FWkZmj4KHc82uXa-lTyfavCW3P0jA4_QKYPckTBS2MajBNT19DaQGiUVhlwH4DRA_X1kE8wmDM7BBBV_wn9lYIgoa1JEa9HIs5rbU8VuiNMUcGr9VIJ-bHNOj__erMuCseR__hT9w26U050FL0M2ZuUqyY4awcpdVxNMprybOASJNheobEJa7WbIsS1RksKvM=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZjL085norYwK34TYkzGIPVTH8VRAJlwTwMH70iPU6pJe1NMNT6nOZuFXvXPlOT8hSwFPdMPouw_HIfIGhWxoFgWSv9nFkBptARLfZfgSs8HN78stm1E4uVYf-3N4I-3UT-L5SVRXY4NcJt982T2hNMoYJ1VTGzh3XLn5mcH-aT44MtjHaIMtA36TpQ6o8l_g1YUxhr9cgFBEiuhlFZVc9lq-6M2wLpB-13X1lGPB2mFg40Qwge2QRmnmVmi_BBenMOvKGmZWEy5w4nsJtCtRFsqamakgcy4_Z8srCMAcs0qDY68Wuzq3Om5dJsFKpQA1l8D_6vl7_UZmkoyDd9RW6ZeIF2GoR8tri4Ay4IfAtpkVtTIv-qUllmGt1snh4pBVgjfWZJroypn-SGoiGW_k_v6vgvLH8FV1r46-ic8vNOOSmjn0_NvWRkfLQpR3877fiHrFsH332euB3pBeZOukyZSuCDlvte-_PH5HHrmourenICssOIHDQSUM0uv9vUUimqSOFVbkhJRG8W3Cp1NaIYjd3h8tqnBB6cIVJJnEf2k=w278-h156-no'),
(4, 'Ganymede', 110, 'Ganymede /ˈɡænɨmiːd/ (Jupiter III) is the largest moon of Jupiter and in the Solar System, and the only moon known to have a magnetosphere. It is the seventh satellite outward from Jupiter and third of the Galilean moons, the first group of objects discovered orbiting another planet. Completing an orbit in roughly seven days, Ganymede participates in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io, respectively. With a diameter of 5,268 km (3,273 mi), it is 8% larger than the planet Mercury, but has only 45% as much mass. Its diameter is 2% larger than that of Saturn''s Titan, the Solar System''s second-largest moon. At 2.02 times the mass of the Moon, it is the most massive planetary satellite. It is the 9th largest object in the Solar System, and the largest without a substantial atmosphere.\r\n\r\n<p>Ganymede is composed of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water ice. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth''s oceans together. Its surface is composed of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover about a third of the satellite. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain''s disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity brought about by tidal heating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ganymede''s magnetosphere was probably created through convection within its liquid iron core. The meager magnetosphere is buried within Jupiter''s much larger magnetic field and would show only as a local perturbation of the field lines. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O<sub>2</sub>, and possibly O<sub>3</sub> (ozone). Atomic hydrogen is a minor atmospheric constituent. Whether the satellite has an ionosphere associated with its atmosphere is unresolved.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>Ganymede''s discovery is credited to Galileo Galilei, who was the first to observe it on January 7, 1610. The satellite''s name was soon suggested by astronomer Simon Marius, for the mythological Ganymede, cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus''s lover. Beginning with Pioneer 10, spacecraft have been able to examine Ganymede closely. The Voyager probes refined measurements of its size, whereas the Galileo craft discovered its underground ocean and magnetic field. The next planned mission to the Jovian system is the European Space Agency''s Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), due to launch in 2022. After flybys of all three icy Galilean moons, the probe is planned to enter orbit around Ganymede.</p>', 'Jupiter', 2634.1, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RRhTluSsegmyQ3a-gqIO_nBJTs8L5zFgjiuwPKb35s70d_yzge82FGVMBbHBw3Hp0WhPRuY9nz-7rRrZrGYBsbUvfHqNqRZndSoRfkrbIKyItjUcZGfKvjsJX2OJUZy5OFkXNnDlkjxujFadm0LEfS2S4Di3VSluQtJjlgsxHMH3dfdQucY7oLvwrWVhV2IlJLuhz62xWVmnc_7DNu13G-OYaDV2pKawGIUNkjXRBU5XiZh5i-3yUb-3xampE4gApKvoG3C4iyXH7FSUugwlh0R88_nHqUCRqIAyysztktHXFhrguRQonP1ogUsgEhBhRCVVt9kt1Cngl0OM6mmtgsx1yW29-9Mc1aEhv2dfWdnLHK9aMF8mqF3BDPCYaO1eyztpwX1ksO9yrBCGGzqoCA53a1g9YzA6jEHE-JRNahFqc-faiPBR8879Icps4_DLKrvjy6xUINOSWXAaOkIetdzIPUug5-YOiwOSOdRz1XSZVGzFVSyjC3bvBsKMvHzDuqZVUAMPWcQvBsARHBdtrbcrPvNbcTu4swa2dS1eqVg=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W5gsHiBpqJvK8JQwdaEuTb-m4nMWU6MyT3vA-NO5oY_oDEUDx3ICrHzLQfAwGz2IoAjGq00MUvQjOWnfFrpmd6Pg2vCwqUHW5lPueX27UhUsBezWhpCiWLhySapO5LrhsS3CIsIwVp1vnOu4unF7THquaCTZlOf9AnDBBXJvIKlwLyY6iFttr9TZwB1_G7mscGCbu3cjs2vQbZO2plaTj-l6ypTJhykyxDRjkpK1VcrRX2fh6sq1E0uQmCmtxIyaHri2Eih1jTsG9VttgmpfQN6HrdQdDB6iTz6-cC9U8G84H0GOOV5Lfc-LC4bHXzxXtFqSkcLzCsXkWT8yDBpPGoVPuwR4xMPSvRYjH1v65l1O6Kp-7PghsACu8-6dWQrkfVhNqQh6YtJ5dtZWOF7zP0T59yOVzBuK5aAiYwFK5fZE8rTf4PmnBDh5zF481addCxTXNX2_bbAMvJEWsHLUgG2cb_ULJWKxgRn6uU5yK7U3UREf4rhj_A48Zu-AgIwlE7JpFaIKeDZ60QG0QcCo3S4j3C8UmJSXGKRL_H6OWJ4=w400-h225-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FCJdCgZ9NUVOeJI_XE60ZlpT_SavuBMfasDTMCfBGEXNKTSnLpVnSgZvAq6Bu36ruxXG_il9AZ-WuTD77BB5MwsueHQYdQwbLNvClViI9j2kXHp5HbNedIZBtKDEWgCoaxNFjr0DbzKypP6cPqTzgMf773JcN4w73jPLbtfThBRoeyqI5gnZ1YcRxDzMbMPpdJHqVeiGiptI8xM_PxquFYxmwj1OfdXkHjsQCjmKy-LOz4YpRoUJn0pzNJi89zIeodTheW_tvb3cgJxumkKi_ub81s5Aa4dXfneWosOjWpJVDPU7xRWBIFjarxHrTw7xVXZTgCBiOodCuT5qwj8FKgqWpko0gRNnL6e2vYgTKoiWwfpULVT1XebaC6o7T9xmX2HMev5w-NMoHnq3b2dXMRGwmrs37P9GljC-oZ57Uusg5x4Rdk2_P6kYomQxWlyfw8J8hM-gpM5hTdC-2aYeIY65hSEO1J8-NwbXusMGZE139_40a70TY8b6YolwMadez-RvHpXbXRE80k6_vI4kdV1ym-KBAam-DFkhQjQvXkY=w1505-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W5gsHiBpqJvK8JQwdaEuTb-m4nMWU6MyT3vA-NO5oY_oDEUDx3ICrHzLQfAwGz2IoAjGq00MUvQjOWnfFrpmd6Pg2vCwqUHW5lPueX27UhUsBezWhpCiWLhySapO5LrhsS3CIsIwVp1vnOu4unF7THquaCTZlOf9AnDBBXJvIKlwLyY6iFttr9TZwB1_G7mscGCbu3cjs2vQbZO2plaTj-l6ypTJhykyxDRjkpK1VcrRX2fh6sq1E0uQmCmtxIyaHri2Eih1jTsG9VttgmpfQN6HrdQdDB6iTz6-cC9U8G84H0GOOV5Lfc-LC4bHXzxXtFqSkcLzCsXkWT8yDBpPGoVPuwR4xMPSvRYjH1v65l1O6Kp-7PghsACu8-6dWQrkfVhNqQh6YtJ5dtZWOF7zP0T59yOVzBuK5aAiYwFK5fZE8rTf4PmnBDh5zF481addCxTXNX2_bbAMvJEWsHLUgG2cb_ULJWKxgRn6uU5yK7U3UREf4rhj_A48Zu-AgIwlE7JpFaIKeDZ60QG0QcCo3S4j3C8UmJSXGKRL_H6OWJ4=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vgESEjFoE_yEYtDInqiMezIYO8yaZdjPFWjAa7M1539bMqx2sUXozLz90dTscwheFN1qdWSSh0Wwksphh9sHV6JAwDWkVF0fV3GcmWakCOfMWIWXluGOdfMwP4lCV4jiSqmfTIfSVe4h_JKtu47TH-vL0DgenyHSPqDYnrNfCQ9ClDm0kwBJGZPcBxZob42GLt5-gvD35o2mgg9gxO8LLy8_X0GTwozkAtNAQJmL8gosXjMK-v4xe9R09veX_BQCIZGlpd_WwYKPGQU_Loi4wK0WSF-vrxdMcZyRkdyJJcx2f5IVvK5ZhV-RUr3uFPa60hqfzGQl0Aq1yOWnHdynK6iNy1RxC_4a4zeNTVUm9bxQZLDoEpqosan2f_8SMFPlJ_zpeMf4ALrau54Dh1TXSBdXLacLJXFT-adS_2Irs2QQ4PaBFkH5vjVk8svn9_8aGMFtGLtqQNaeWWKorMpbjYRB_osD19BVc51hBHSve9bOlPQMpBHKWiQh1CBFEvyiZtGPMfUJvhM0Whojqcq5331d5FqhmEiKGWmqAA-e61g=w278-h156-no'),
(5, 'Titania', 70, 'Titania is the largest of the moons of Uranus and the eighth largest moon in the Solar System at a diameter of 1,578 kilometres (981 mi). Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Titania is named after the queen of the fairies in Shakespeare''s A Midsummer Night''s Dream. Its orbit lies inside Uranus''s magnetosphere.\r\n\r\n<p>Titania consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water may be present at the core–mantle boundary. The surface of Titania, which is relatively dark and slightly red in color, appears to have been shaped by both impacts and endogenic processes. It is covered with numerous impact craters reaching up to 326 kilometres (203 mi) in diameter, but is less heavily cratered than the surface of Uranus''s outermost moon, Oberon. Titania probably underwent an early endogenic resurfacing event which obliterated its older, heavily cratered surface. Titania''s surface is cut by a system of enormous canyons and scarps, the result of the expansion of its interior during the later stages of its evolution. Like all major moons of Uranus, Titania probably formed from an accretion disk which surrounded the planet just after its formation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Infrared spectroscopy conducted from 2001 to 2005 revealed the presence of water ice as well as frozen carbon dioxide on the surface of Titania, which in turn suggested that the moon may have a tenuous carbon dioxide atmosphere with a surface pressure of about one 10 trillionth of a bar. Measurements during Titania''s occultation of a star put an upper limit on the surface pressure of any possible atmosphere at 10–20 nbar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Uranian system has been studied up close only once, by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in January 1986. It took several images of Titania, which allowed mapping of about 40% of its surface.</p>', 'Uranus', 788.4, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NtdxNUcODbVuMnVOO7724zAUvoOBD8CbaQhC7ewVRqn8ieFbaCW9FIcehBE-e3jatxAkvIOKDyG22VD5s2TNwWUd82kySLKeCf5KFCdEEWnuPnj8wZ4QplfHHklHpaeENd2ZmpXmd1gW-gNtMNx3vK1SY2M9smeijCcy_j0JSzfj5BmCeKmqJow5e6SOlpZ-JJ16wJ3tD85i0nBTyTbtXHy7bPPlriTkIvVtE3oDWi--7p1bZcnNMMnjPrmSTWqSopzkGoE-fPKsbx4plBfjiH-tbTgNEZ7j40NFHQYUYDspXnhg0_h14r0e_TTuMP4UvuYHmwdwBCgnheVTX6HSEhd-I83oM70RAtlXuNjHVXMsEK9dB7QWfdkN0vPzVw6ouLAJ0kyNPdzIU9fbnjs5PpSMVMjmm6lRSt7x-bsfUqbkLUjZVhp0sBmrLeiNR6kP5rvyZme3Bm1dIL1uYvvPv6ZQI6viLaxg6YcNMsmJtWzlWya0WWULbDjON_jeNa8rosN16oRQgLzdan0Fm3_hk3FVFWc-4i5x8ZPGRcIW6kY=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/M4E9mymndWsd9Iw7WUJPpMU-3kwsANm7hTn3VbAOR6i1uS9OUQoRzjM747KB5yCFGKYDJHZ5eWM5EBo1ifPvfAmjVMqc_7qzf2Zoxdwp-zUmcQihWDmVHcfuiKRxLnYU2M8ApAXrqKCuYRA3i-PIApSqsWHUf62E6pl8SaTUodfefdlwbZuP93eXMJrZhi-p15iGiSEa0J6Yp_DXg-Hni4EP5hulj4KSah0U7bLJH7fu6Wwh2N7lq08mjQNlYjtCLKDR8vp-QmAivGq29jHRh2aI58ufOG3kec2xHLcqx1ZS9Aglc2o94ouSeUrW1_hq32_DTZTUZsXFbtRR_1PPoI3nw63ImJBgJewQURxaDRnHFbD7TYfQ7m04mgPD0fsJ-5vaf2bhxDB_6R9cRLxoYOCUbC0XCiEForbN25lwoMGblISfOwLQArm1SLuAglNsSwrX6PMasiAUVBKAYH9y9y-dRsXjMwcGY2SVngqY7seEdj8E6WSHVJr9c4mj_9Z8f3SFH1m87ciPq53G0WlaVcgajqenMuQy3mhLO5fVq9Y=s700-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eXtdy0wmP8ZRJ934pUEarrSMyyLlSdPzehdRjPEhT5klTgJftKwOeEiFW59qJZbGMG63zigvbczzFpX8Wd4lJ2Phv5lAYm3keBRf49LTS_QQh6fOnBsSCzSE6_ZFjhW6sxWq100m13k76NDBUpIW7T7ck77Z11H3ODcoVCwYnf10msH-m-BfYn4XkUyeDCEuaoaRWdGSV80ZU2MYKD1BUpEH2xtRST2T7s8j3i8bxW4JPvRQKgxNdB7XXWcwJ6mBbeytpy8U-jES5omCci3BNyHffq7fHp1o_V14SfQi2rxHE3cCtamz7zDPxXJ9isYLF1ndYEfPlYe7eN2dwnLDfLkYpCZPJvSNgxsEmuAVaQAYh8rEuEYa8l_Lcl94Mmdsnd3r2mxelyGNe-OZpHgscKZE0wBeSa4Lqsm5ociJC8yUmsUzaHdFLvfccL-vmcq3XsXd2BdqVo0pa2eqDch3Ys1ATRCajPxeCHZe5GFZPx9syR-0oIZFDWEQnxHpH4C17EkzHONMbUfKIz3MZ1gR8DIAa8mqWTp1wmSBLKwXVms=w278-h156-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eXtdy0wmP8ZRJ934pUEarrSMyyLlSdPzehdRjPEhT5klTgJftKwOeEiFW59qJZbGMG63zigvbczzFpX8Wd4lJ2Phv5lAYm3keBRf49LTS_QQh6fOnBsSCzSE6_ZFjhW6sxWq100m13k76NDBUpIW7T7ck77Z11H3ODcoVCwYnf10msH-m-BfYn4XkUyeDCEuaoaRWdGSV80ZU2MYKD1BUpEH2xtRST2T7s8j3i8bxW4JPvRQKgxNdB7XXWcwJ6mBbeytpy8U-jES5omCci3BNyHffq7fHp1o_V14SfQi2rxHE3cCtamz7zDPxXJ9isYLF1ndYEfPlYe7eN2dwnLDfLkYpCZPJvSNgxsEmuAVaQAYh8rEuEYa8l_Lcl94Mmdsnd3r2mxelyGNe-OZpHgscKZE0wBeSa4Lqsm5ociJC8yUmsUzaHdFLvfccL-vmcq3XsXd2BdqVo0pa2eqDch3Ys1ATRCajPxeCHZe5GFZPx9syR-0oIZFDWEQnxHpH4C17EkzHONMbUfKIz3MZ1gR8DIAa8mqWTp1wmSBLKwXVms=w278-h156-no'),
(6, 'Titan', 93.7, 'Titan (or Saturn VI) is the largest moon of Saturn. It is the only natural satellite known to have a dense atmosphere, and the only object other than Earth where clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid has been found.\r\n\r\n<p>Titan is the sixth ellipsoidal moon from Saturn. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan''s diameter is 50% larger than Earth''s natural satellite, the Moon, and it is 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System, after Jupiter''s moon Ganymede, and is larger by volume than the smallest planet, Mercury, although only 40% as massive. Discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, and the fifth known satellite of another planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Titan is primarily composed of water ice and rocky material. Much as with Venus before the Space Age, the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan''s surface until new information accumulated when the Cassini–Huygens mission arrived in 2004, including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in Titan''s polar regions. The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few impact craters, although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The atmosphere of Titan is largely nitrogen; minor components lead to the formation of methane–ethane clouds and nitrogen-rich organic smog. The climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as dunes, rivers, lakes, seas (probably of liquid methane–ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, Titan''s methane cycle is analogous to Earth''s water cycle, although at a much lower temperature.</p>', 'Saturn', 2576, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qgTVhJ9-I_98JNbTVm_rvqw_rr814TtvnlY7XHS0mB-97SF-aSzGX8-DbeAauCcuX1WdNG4QLvbrNwHKWxwWpWN_3pXs9bqzJV3EOpOp58wE2a6riqDuuYHHdYpet7K3IsRYfNcDLFd_ddFy9JZEW41ckpA_SFJAZj60HOFCQ8lagJ3L5kGkqgd0jZ0ujkQ-OSS2ZJPZW_9zCtglMoV2kTsORgICUxO_qA1aCLRNyGbDPjpLdovRZlz0rO1I4IyQfU2btMyezIgzBKAZ9ZglePtaODBlT_6RkxG3tRTv3MQPH65eyfn7dmNdUCTXadr3Tdrkbr66bhD1KMkFABOskXDPB6y5O0xGrudfk4_BvpsuSCoQQx9hyIRDwFahRWdMTLWojfryn5m6oDwAXjOwKWBXZPppPCJqjeSEAqM1lz-auBZkFDNeuilzxW0SMOS1q-BolYqsoQBGMea7hgjOg3UDHmj2apHTKXDyyXGhNGw4irbmYW1MtSFXDyGfJ9-EYHGAvQA40I8LRKSeZdTvzlWxsYTm7I1dtVTZqjhI6ck=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lYG3chcAVFQzUcA8-eImmFytE1KpLEAUN0-EEdnKej6Xl9jYB9MpYY--szaEQGFgyVOSm72BZJquJCLa65WRmjAnDiG6cVTpLsDotQmNpsPISlUL5uXDmNXJzABx632sZ-mHS_2zfQLjZSXEA7hSRE_3r-tgICoT9fBtQ2uzrT5Ff6kswoq2X8XnAIStCAoe2BiTKIoMJDQYbI2eF6nic91aycJelqXLg9HvhmYm3_lYeV_iHM8JW3GTDHGjtG5czSOu89x9e5P05Qu1yJZJKqEnNVFnm3DKIN6mugVetgOoW2eyfXcQul926PWxXqCfoUWSNAgkMKLwl2AXkaq6c-Z58FQOaXA99AKn3jLvb1FqQnZXQRC44b3L-gxZdywNvE7mz_Z5QdVBcYwOTDB_VJonoVAuAiVZhrYzq2XX7lKUO90T8Qj59Bvyls7GEg08iMCfQhOwtirQwkFkpie36JfdsGo3FgbBk4Jau5veHLNtTnrMSQ57AMObvLB-HI61bSjFXkbDuFkqJqtMSdaldzxA-74kBhVtIw2DEuQxbks=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lYG3chcAVFQzUcA8-eImmFytE1KpLEAUN0-EEdnKej6Xl9jYB9MpYY--szaEQGFgyVOSm72BZJquJCLa65WRmjAnDiG6cVTpLsDotQmNpsPISlUL5uXDmNXJzABx632sZ-mHS_2zfQLjZSXEA7hSRE_3r-tgICoT9fBtQ2uzrT5Ff6kswoq2X8XnAIStCAoe2BiTKIoMJDQYbI2eF6nic91aycJelqXLg9HvhmYm3_lYeV_iHM8JW3GTDHGjtG5czSOu89x9e5P05Qu1yJZJKqEnNVFnm3DKIN6mugVetgOoW2eyfXcQul926PWxXqCfoUWSNAgkMKLwl2AXkaq6c-Z58FQOaXA99AKn3jLvb1FqQnZXQRC44b3L-gxZdywNvE7mz_Z5QdVBcYwOTDB_VJonoVAuAiVZhrYzq2XX7lKUO90T8Qj59Bvyls7GEg08iMCfQhOwtirQwkFkpie36JfdsGo3FgbBk4Jau5veHLNtTnrMSQ57AMObvLB-HI61bSjFXkbDuFkqJqtMSdaldzxA-74kBhVtIw2DEuQxbks=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Dc8lYOpPBR3-64Z9FO2uKmWoIC6TnBXc5TSWS_N7tdt09B2dPOMibSPACiHZjHBZJBJjpNQalHX-CKnKiMD-1UGobjnkyCHAcg2t2oxEQBFvw8mRReSQ_y7DbUthzqLIRY2C4K5E0Eh9BQGaBSY50ffIJDe00rFwhoeHkt3uzKUPg2k1d_uq6wQwzEWPcbvg0BXMzgN-IVrl3tvrVQgPBuz_uHyChx6akbLXFe9bPLiITZkM7rDymuzOl41SrGZWgQ1cvfAFk0D5hHEC3Ky8VVyVdnmmFOYmFWYhIs2eVYAW05tLqmsHujEWUk8HW5O-4vpsnam6YLmzskwypC06Fba9IOB_XJOCJmibmvwnFFMTbEdrJwteMu-cpT7th31CV09w18v4daayJUYhn4Brb8zBzGkuNQiFjnootWjoEPBsSNhtg6f_iZ0e7jacapd2MclxNAa0qMDvD2OvEnnRlCPxqLQsXIVO0rAsmmJYBbFKsAvlHwo3xlvgOxmO_CBGEPmrdE7EhtjQDM3DtWP39RUoRiJmWYcij7kDLXRZygc=w278-h156-no'),

It is so close that it orbits Mars faster than Mars rotates, and completes an orbit in just 7 hours and 39 minutes. As a result, from the surface of Mars it appears to rise in the west, move across the sky in 4 hours 15 min or less, and set in the east, twice each Martian day. Due to tidal interactions, Phobos is drawing closer to Mars by one meter every century, and it is predicted that in 50 million years it will collide with the planet or break up into a planetary ring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phobos is one of the least reflective bodies in the Solar System, and features a large impact crater, Stickney.

(8, 'Deimos', 233, 'Deimos (systematic designation: Mars II) is the smaller and outer of the two natural satellites of the planet Mars with a mean radius of 6.2 km, the other being Phobos. Deimos takes 30.3 hours to orbit Mars. The name "Deimos" is pronounced /ˈdaɪməs/ DY-məs, or sometimes /ˈdiːməs/ DEE-məs or like the Greek Δείμος. In Greek mythology, Deimos was the twin brother of Phobos and personified Terror.\r\n\r\n<p>Deimos was discovered by Asaph Hall, Sr. at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C on 12 August 1877, at about 07:48 UTC (given in contemporary sources as "11 August 14:40" Washington mean time, using an astronomical convention of beginning a day at noon, so 12 hours must be added to get the actual local mean time). Hall also discovered Phobos on 18 August 1877, at about 09:14 GMT, after deliberately searching for Martian moons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is named after Deimos, a figure representing dread in Greek Mythology. The names, at first spelled Phobus and Deimus, were suggested by Henry Madan (1838–1901), Science Master of Eton, from Book XV of the Iliad, where Ares (the Roman god Mars) summons Dread (Deimos) and Fear (Phobos).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deimos, like Mars''s other moon, Phobos, has spectra, albedos and densities similar to those of a C- or D-type asteroid. Like most bodies of its size, Deimos is highly non-spherical with triaxial dimensions of 15 × 12.2 × 11 km, making it 0.56 times the size of Phobos. Deimos is composed of rock rich in carbonaceous material, much like C-type asteroids and carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. It is cratered, but the surface is noticeably smoother than that of Phobos, caused by the partial filling of craters with regolith. The regolith is highly porous and has a radar-estimated density of only 1.471 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.

(9, 'Umbriel', 75, 'Umbriel is a moon of Uranus discovered on October 24, 1851, by William Lassell. It was discovered at the same time as Ariel and named after a character in Alexander Pope''s poem The Rape of the Lock. Umbriel consists mainly of ice with a substantial fraction of rock, and may be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts. However, the presence of canyons suggests early endogenic processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface.\r\n\r\n<p>Covered by numerous impact craters reaching 210 km (130 mi) in diameter, Umbriel is the second most heavily cratered satellite of Uranus after Oberon. The most prominent surface feature is a ring of bright material on the floor of Wunda crater. This moon, like all moons of Uranus, probably formed from an accretion disk that surrounded the planet just after its formation. The Uranian system has been studied up close only once, by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in January 1986. It took several images of Umbriel, which allowed mapping of about 40% of the moon’s surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Umbriel, along with another Uranian satellite, Ariel, was discovered by William Lassell on October 24, 1851. Although William Herschel, the discoverer of Titania and Oberon, claimed at the end of the 18th century that he had observed four additional moons of Uranus, his observations were not confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of Uranus''s moons are named after characters created by William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 at the request of Lassell. Umbriel is the "dusky melancholy sprite" in Alexander Pope''s The Rape of the Lock, and the name suggests the Latin umbra, meaning shadow. The moon is also designated Uranus II</p>', 'Uranus', 584.7, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xK7MYyGbdMi2WvjMGe4DHNTyb7p-yAlYT9wZsZVuLkRuE5pNDWXMM47Xbr4ybet7O9pqBvdy4SsRdGsRDfzQDvblOjl-0gRXQZxtDmtW2Oz3nxzZ1yaQmLoZhlNUnauTER-q_KdHr8GcmO3FoYcxj2zcITxzP1XSt8NRX46-ruVmGVKbcsaiQvIKgFHVmkeFM-DeRmn0ehgkHwjoscWoi3AulcTewSGjywn97Amq_D-yOqXu4hwe4NPUEdg0MqJH3wgjAu73Ui1APTkoKfMi_COr-gV_ywxpQV6NIHJVI0DXLmZtvRKAZdGQlGWG_xJjvqN7e3zmxjdCwmFXWn76rOzuDz0eCX19ob9wcRs14q6tFN66HC2Z3_ykRYDYDi4zooSNB9Di0VNflscEU0FodBsLVDKgOv8dMXnnKc9gMF_t7JAD80c77g_D3RxqqlDkU7KJrjutDH47ueri0QxKPG_uLo47fVWfM4n2XwLxZONLDqlew6yljX8qnwDSt6uNl1_kNWd9xid283u2yu_9mOUqHumdnJBdakhvAk9PNLk=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/m97fdGC84wvPpg8gaA-UeEInFlGry3mZ45VIKXKUZOfvUsSWA_0J5LZoaA0fPuUchcMTtAUF0-eITCCoB5GmRX0Wb0tXlMIr5txELHfElg9DPiJ-6eADoYUwGYf440dICpf6fpouBdyi5sjti6K0rJ_IwjyYOqt-EYia-2QBqxv56EMN2FI6refi6876PoYlgC7F-J2gXfDnTxvr1NKb5Mglh1mrK_5f9QwSo9jZJpK7BAoz1dUt2jrwtUXmb7UiSK6QehNH_DZRn1VmrH8FeY3NT23U1rluESMSH3U8TfPIeCNkVbE3J7S0Myvy9QB67aTXTAhNu0rNHPZt2WOrIjLaKIKjaAOWA5-kmoFtoegE6our61i3c43wDh2irwT6WqXoH7flTQgGxHLirwAYokn0ZtJLy0C15dT3YYy_rGju8qJnL_EuaaLiHQUNGMSht5QHzOKQL9PZ03fzbYryYShxTkXyfyPMvbIaAxKgirz5bZcLI2uk0wKyXKkUQ3ch2XQ8dyYMiPuISU9PkwrZDKENDimFy80zDj95xzin-N4=s702-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vgf7Y0lAO5CC-_47puCrsGUMGl__LaL2-ACUfFPwsLnHJRj2TcGw1ax7pzMjNoG3qraAZmaWkPFdWQRpnfqcmK26WiF9oyv4b4WQ5E7cs70UjkQXt3UF4LMn-XO0RPFHAgggTef46L2wLFxXaAmGiM68CiD5df3V7WUmp0XIx-2pjOxvXqVH9fcnKD8DXxJ7_7IHX07CJ35D3G9tTvq3RjU0QCvS8-5mYsROxsJ3ZTMz9gxxNXj_jSN0rzcStmre4zdifHhLEmkm53QY3a6mE73DFJeWKnaMT4xdzFCKruBJWA18GT7SJUDh3bHex_Vz8s6OdneiyS43m83LBGJ0ZRaqsRExESIjt3RRYPuWaVpD4fwlvxIj7evd01pA0d9h8JFcxAvv0mqrbREwCGSor8eBvr6WWZu6UPqslw3S2f1CtyQmv6G9pFFnRH1q1xAj9kHCYKncxQl-wGVj8nXDpiy1OU_tXVenjhEOpwYlSU4IrQPouOniCObx0Kn109UluFKVaEQoPc23qX8j6WNZrwvRabjuBRJc9w1FPuRjV8I=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MlXt7-KT5y0XCdS2T8XcMxFIHAg9RAQb-d_4SbVGyfCQUSW3ZvTGd1lat8e300WEFczBh7Y7QsvIBCDeZDCEZZVtTuQl5BhTKJdqmHgqoisvqvG4OTOsQf0WZxyKlCkrDmRpt4_D3W8m7zU5QOXhbfDD_0qi8-3UCzIoEKwbegt1sg28c9HjgbtAuugcXHeL0bAQ_Gvbk-Sc7vntURfMus69-FS5zvVQwhvq9xc5jJvH6B-2HBYt-86pLc7HwMTsOfGufC3luQJwwlD187lCHphgPVXhl1DX6cpFY4BgBdTkyUAApjZx6xHMIL5juBTOEkSkjyY2iwJeLdMcNFF6q06jU4UrFcbfX1B3y1pkv7YrRd0WhJyu5u1sKcYscf8Zh12os_MKJUv2B1HOYCFKWIRBzc8AImnXhhOC8vMY9ae3p98f05F7O8WlypWzRdO4TdgKwuuJjzWpI9BKo4QtLdBeJQRs2j3sbLVZVPxp4yrBExAlbWABF4-xqBSSttMo2zHdGrdCE-LCyz1qqz0QdcAqgfQBoFbIQ_qdFSAkw94=w278-h156-no'),
(10, 'Ariel', 60, 'Ariel is the fourth-largest of the 27 known moons of Uranus. Ariel orbits and rotates in the equatorial plane of Uranus, which is almost perpendicular to the orbit of Uranus, and so has an extreme seasonal cycle.\r\n\r\n<p>It was discovered in October 1851 by William Lassell, and named for a character in two different pieces of literature. As of 2012, much of the detailed knowledge of Ariel derives from a single flyby of Uranus performed by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986, which managed to image around 35% of the moon''s surface. There are no active plans at present to return to study the moon in more detail, although various concepts such as a Uranus orbiter and probe are proposed from time to time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Miranda, Ariel is the second-smallest of Uranus'' five major rounded satellites, and the second-closest to its planet. Among the smallest of the Solar System''s 19 known spherical moons (it ranks 14th among them in diameter), it is believed to be composed of roughly equal parts ice and rocky material. Like all of Uranus'' moons, Ariel probably formed from an accretion disc that surrounded the planet shortly after its formation, and, like other large moons, it is likely differentiated, with an inner core of rock surrounded by a mantle of ice. Ariel has a complex surface consisting of extensive cratered terrain cross-cut by a system of scarps, canyons and ridges. The surface shows signs of more recent geological activity than other Uranian moons, most likely due to tidal heating.</p>', 'Uranus', 578.9, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/duHglJAAXqyy6m_wkvk1zP0HzTc1i2LtWZPLij8NpHNX6CuGg_kpI2XH6XM8rngw9O-cXNEhmodOHlWsX2zIH-KB204BgpscbsBlthznxrxXWa_bISNeBStOCd5-F-TUw-8g6hFbyB4djXRVOOZv1FPLZypj2CF9TLl9j9EHK4rYnzXb_54VSYWKkUVrSFuCBECpLOwm4KPaE__4tRoyIe8Set8Uoc7YltAnOFL1FdL71d918YMctC9WdA6WA5quCCHASA6K1F3szw0QKb9tYKsiDdhrVNwwiwPEJxzS7y7cs1j8CRqrbuqpeNKOTwM0e9pia2eYIbPruF5mvh2sasGrrRRSYLZ7qLjx35zCunzjhp9EiFxQYS_BmEiR1Q6a8H4G4czRoFeuHNUgRprb_DVrkycjKBBjgkB3ipPSbDzHIx7qxW4sExJyVuVfkv_5pIQKLyTHwC-_U5YHUuSz2LM1O7unluqxk1W4OmujZmx9qcyvaM71rkcDeMDveMJWXBftYYx_qzHsHQ6VWFMH7XrV6FcvVeyQGG1-iuc24h8=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/E1DFK7b9TzSi98QD0EB2ixoU30FY_zWOWHm-JsbSuFW_GUvNk4DKTPdYG7amG67EQ4sgohqFgizOh8JDIAdZbNKl05HZZ7tyD-JdCz1vYI8UWy2fP9mxWgn4FsyGxQ-pEGVmkyCqM0hn-dHLl_gInbeOZUKDxUCp0Pvno74hbyidQy8rLU9HFDq5diSLMGJxd7UsYSfW9nJd_06H9uglP314B93MJ2IvuOLZXgtDSyuuwCRNL-rEZRW6MBtsJqwvmfOOZVV3IK7Mk5IHvQa64zBXVvjb1RHq5yTvEZVE-Ui3FCHgNV4KMgIFl01tLR5YXNe8h5cpZ3X6xyRiXX_iQhWagelIEKR08Ut3UoWIZbNTYnCba6q6IeT4tZbc7Z_hqoO-OXm7ae2DWru0IlammC2lG6eTv6yZpWC76eIpLPNtAFJGyDngdvtmT0iRMww0BOVCQwebx9I0lPiEzp3z57DR9KIat3lXWAIoX0KRlY1o1JQLzPPvUvDZynUmI-AWdrkLFxhQFx3omtsayZzg-dTIVFN1tX6ET-Iqf6QUyu4=w845-h650-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t0d1fpxZl1EdMi3oCKQ1pdnfU5xwWpNrLX9iC0hDIzm0HAGkxoN21S5V3hhDDl2bhnAFMoouElKWyPrkpZFeCAD7K6Rq3lQiU-lKPpAgVzoj-rPCuJPGDDD-_5JYKbDEe8LyxbXUmoTZAJxkzE4kX2hXwFa90kKJyxvcebO20OgpAdVcbgmasEf7WyPBrHH3J5isgUysIbDa_kKOsfIhAgaeXXgjV-a1Rm6XflrFw3isQYwfBk82DTzgE2WPYenYk_prXwXtCqBqAoIIVbZUfeM8sIJxkppTppUm0RlBMLcvfTg2nUoPGJwtFfoGjAnuUn0-VLgKTR9ogjRlgEWd_1V4hlYdN7ILEbWWEfi7Sf3U725z690stBRR0cXDcm9jE6FFVXqxuEnMHC7tkRvO4F0It8ZI77CVl2oUQIepRZQX1FrQgjSdxTQpdYC7qJzjzdT9YflJyT9PrtjxLEJxehvHVZNP8udWkXhycfPnRd-kx-Hm-PyLRxWsyXA8bh_sTW4nkNPma4nKvy3j5WYvnLeD_wg11fE2ae14a_3JIWg=s799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RHLRWkUy0wtzhu7IF0Gip7u4KmGHOEgYZa3aN2EsERdreYOU2WsqAGMjhx6dFe4JIYBNwuKGeqPXXHNIDvnERmyXaDwM0hnHgv-Dp36WRjTNrvae__FHj2aeqFw4-2-a7J9l42wtUHdd4Z2uI1q4GyeSrNbfo6QQLlDbitPyxttB4NvitW08JuYYH-NPczntYlfvsVogkRTUDahZYzl-JWUhQGycyColZNKTsm_CsAWV-c2-PPJBACEPdbU-V5rlD21gH2nK5IroFnN95jDos2yCEgpoN4ABw67IdWut1VSNijY1DrflRj2V3FlKcOCD-qhoCjzJmfmmUskyMKNzgTLxrGjlbCVfJenM3yhNgtlBUI-NAehyyjGPDqe-0n1RyIhDGQ7--75hDF1bXgUSr3dIlO83KYDJzok_XxZZ1JsXWONKWj1DHI-KxV630SHBobQSTPmggxnghSr9jIThUdx6hDDyhwSJtUCqjOJ3fN8qnhQ1m9_l2vHyY832PKWFW1bCwH2cb5ulac8zH_3Ey5eQfN9VArxfSlWRYJ7VMY=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SiwiTevRlGSODEStlRitjZcxBteQKg2g8C70EHRXDLNd4pi26hrQs-X_x4voSJRvZD0qr422WF7hbR_XqMqrAUCfAZTjf1z4hvkWnN-Hmby2USS-DfQ3jn8Oq27nAs68xRG54bYeF7I6Ii8ZcVg5FdYkSd1fjLIUa0Yv-h2xfkP7yBV_mnB7EFJIpYbtxSHb2H8DL-l_XnmVnbLqtPdd48i4XFk355EkkuKsgrjSDcG3zyzim_Eic2IzeXK_w_x-Qdx5YntOYqJNy-CFgPamAeAgT5uUfRrCP_IMYMjq4TqwwjiNiA9RcbpxjRAOBewaL9gQW4eK1EyFt4aNVG7SXd4p4bJseNNVzWlOsPaG-bxO8BwrPP4hrZaz_xJ3O16tlg8XeRsLOuoj54J2OMNsMZb_I2CgWN7KbpT9COvPfYOyXjAS9szSLmCAoNKmldAUxPrCQ61yavHHVfiXPg15pS3ZHgaTTeo0UolnOJFyacOo5qZv8oQlXgS4qL-p0Yw4n37mqkcy2g3Ah399jL54pPPnh4VlgEwoeIVlVCtSaAQ=w278-h156-no');

(11, 'Enceladus', 75, 'Enceladus is the sixth-largest moon of Saturn. It was discovered in 1789 by William Herschel, but little was known about it until the two Voyager spacecraft passed nearby in the early 1980s.[15] The Voyagers showed that the diameter of Enceladus is only 500 kilometers (310 mi), about a tenth of that of Saturn''s largest moon, Titan, and that it reflects almost all the sunlight that strikes it. It is mostly covered by fresh, clean ice and the surface temperature at noon only reaches −198 °C. Enceladus has a wide range of surface features ranging from old, heavily cratered regions to young, tectonically deformed terrains that formed as recently as 100 million years ago, despite its small size.\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft started multiple close flybys of Enceladus, revealing its surface and environment in greater detail. In particular, Cassini discovered a water-rich plume venting from the south polar region of Enceladus. Cryovolcanoes near the south pole shoot geyser-like jets of water vapor, other volatiles, and solid material, including sodium chloride crystals and ice particles, into space, totaling approximately 200 kilograms (440 lb) per second. Over 100 geysers have been identified. Some of the water vapor falls back as "snow"; the rest escapes, and supplies most of the material making up Saturn''s E ring. According to NASA scientists, the plumes at Enceladus seem similar in chemical makeup to comets.[22] In 2014, NASA reported that Cassini found evidence for a large south polar subsurface ocean of liquid water within Enceladus with a thickness of around 10 km.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>hese geyser observations, along with the finding of escaping internal heat and very few (if any) impact craters in the south polar region, show that Enceladus is geologically active today. Enceladus is, like many satellites in the extensive systems of giant planets, trapped in an orbital resonance. Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity, which tidal forces damp, resulting in tidal heating of its interior, and offering a possible explanation for the geological activity.</p>', 'Saturn', 252.1, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zEmp39N9Sq4zSr0FsoZD1gjV9MY6kFMez1z9sNkLa6SYlthwQ6LxOmQNsLe94DYN91eUBiFYDo4TlHvYveW5lZQOwG0aFCgKf27PlH85LuU8jkxOt1U3v4ekCn_94Ksp2uMoPIPPi8s1G8B8kOjmU66oyG6ft01Y001o-dWNEr7Ort9qNInmrN_EjxG3y8nDSDVbFhHQqX1jf-5MavlUlykZ1rnL-bLmqdf1ADLQiKuC9IERedWQKw4RZZm76V-Xfkw2dPcrQdd0d1sVgzzk0BIo3-93CROW3t_dnKjS2LIoVyMjDIsW2fkUNwpVePbPDvTREwk-K5t7yZOwGrJnGlfJhgg4DkLtv5kwJ9z8Zb2nhRKOi5EZ1ec5iX6TbsQwLID0ieCmUYctMBK7ikmF73RtL4gJvf8lX0bh_qebaugRchkp7oKQa2FjccbucIUJakYb_zC19qJCXMswEYCHwZ6tKhOlMbbWzOeaEiEhwdH6GFUulPrBmeKal7y6mwbTv-ofO52YlKy9RcgufJjAtlnBd7_hmvGHcjNuD5PMsUI=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/L8GGTmbP35ViBHB4FqV3G1MV4BDmPTGekdOm3DRHk4vQA11pzNFzeZLyP6wMW7y4p_a8WreOsxHK9Kjo18Eni4LlMp6FdSbSZvz6TH6bBPhS2thm2cnKt1OjfatmxDIZeYVmN3uoEz1HJJTr9iul-E-_xc5bfwn3_d4Xat1Bpu-xWO3DW_1tWN49E-AWDPndq3iacgPQcGuwbpdpzAdQyRIkw4nd_Fh2Eq3COdEt9LCyBPjTEsfHQsGos-MgkwNIMLX0-DyWkaICIZOCBCFNWLlVcvF1SSOucmi9AbTwafoU4UjeFZwj30PI7KHxYwz8aiyDim07yaa3N8oSH2-DrnDOPcF0vY0wnWAtQ4M6A_-JZPeHcPzbRptFitzoowJDHzmhazorzYZXxwuuZD955fBOSh6JN1TnVEmJMG5HQ2_MmmHj0A6YS_vKDndVKRgCUN7P20qN9y6DS9OhrF4T7QSxFHxchnHTqQY2H8GxmUqwTKIgZbYGcsvLovmLMDjOBE3tjmifO4bXNqjgdaeUZWcgaLIZTWPL2TA1DYdnqIE=w1066-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iRDg-gBDu2S_Lb_glCg-NQsZzC7Lh0OpI7732ycDNexp1u4-VxDuMCxl9Tlm3SIbe2LwX0-mi6jZJT_aQT69JHnwCNKfVnlf-6BWyN8P8F3xrHApeMLYe7eW9Q1iVrOCUwNxxPUAlx2B1WiCvW8S99-1RNykl9r0kMniQJAkpRIn4xzoj_bHagIkB_ymS_a6svi8EX0M7yMw-rjWVeiN5Ejm4psAa9mzo2ESyjHqCGf5FGYLTzCFdZ-IOf6Otl-Bilf-eer-Gv9zhE6z0GPrE_FSHBxFQT2rlfCDUVEZqHqM4qNQCtZluiGusliuR62ud48bS5C_mItkx0UnJ6Hf3O3sKIITvt4Lb7nfTX87Qv9V1LgZ-CHUTumpi17OssuVHdoFYsK_V7CSU3eHrkpnnQ1j-W1PpAizK2YkhQTI_LojqIlX2QWEfeYeeZ63Hqd7vrmL2q5DQhYlMqoxfOwkx3vVG2nJyub4SXED0YEE4z8pgXgCPaYe5hxpLqA-QP9245h6sLNZORnZO1jNCK5_lbz6RFmWkt3TSgSjr3642c0=w1024-h576-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DcQRuhN_geE5LYFa9ZYFUKwdYpQx2h6MxXvIc6ToaTt3gajUWN-024YDUIfRe3Gzgu7lAl0tzBACkVA8z5JW47T1edltvZ1ouldAC1K74aP2zdhCbrp_TpQ8O6vNjDXbo8-tEETIO2OrgtIw0vMqKHbmGjirW6JUr705toHBV4bWST49MJOMHGyk7WLfPEnxg0WsHOUoTTuIu3PLXaRWM3UfPMIjD2v_pBGM8AmgDCd_WCjHvWeQQmwO2mZqlOCvy2cWKxiHgWmlXZ0FQp6Ro1DRO4eGD-up0smNoMIbIujYFK4jPCp2Ou3nHkmlGLkr1M2miKWqmr0lTiy0DCCL-SWfFDwvJV9-Fori5N91jx0L57LBH4daEhHPA9-TZXg7Dl2HG3_LdjWWRRnBX3Qu48VAuaxAd7ZjfYaMbMkfxbcpiMnu8FeJvojIHCTQs_Mjo9TA_y9iJ_SfVRgF4glK5-JP-pMWKuDI4Pc4ErzYfzBGLjKd0yx40gxY-BRpy-GpysDLXJNxl0YvBLHVQBay5nOlIWTHZaxHH7Gj12DS1q4=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BcuBZHzKrcGRGIH9WWYgedcL8D2H9HP-x6MulAVC26fYru5TP__JatxIXPVxfBGwGoyCoaqaEX72QGMKkwYNh5qJUkqXeUv6NLosqXJNc-MDuRXJJg4yg5JtK1PrR8B0GhozCOO_JCqsVt_J2IxKCYCaOW46JY9rJBoIBl7BioUGgXPJhXJKg6kMQGUWpdkflVWEd_fud8XNK8ffIIA2o5IPum5Nyt2v6x7q0hQ2PTBPw9btsrCJTBbrOOxiP1ilBC5Gs97usHu0UwbjmZNCAgyIPA7lKq2R22OzOK3Xtcp6LV7AhbO20aZ_saRZ_rBvKznCSedLOdiOw_nNOmF3qGow5LsV3GOn3tnkH31k102byhNdosKVELqiL1MLD-xdwZM_jpXbVSM5-3ZVL3tFYZFbZTiqxF9Thbn4VaDnZ9RP8k9f6OaJIeWWnjet0dncErXJuUA81MWzwjsNvqNWSvsmhhLbUh7dUjIcKXM5HeBvD0SszTWE861dqWGbzSDS9zQRJTn8bQ5UFdjSGtyvzEZj_nGp-i_JE66ZxDQNONA=w278-h156-no'),
(12, 'Mimas', 64, 'Mimas is a moon of Saturn which was discovered in 1789 by William Herschel. It is named after Mimas, a son of Gaia in Greek mythology, and is also designated Saturn I.\r\n\r\n<p>With a diameter of 396 kilometres (246 mi) it is the 21st-largest moon in the Solar System and is the smallest astronomical body that is known to be rounded in shape because of self-gravitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mimas was discovered by the astronomer William Herschel on 17 September 1789. He recorded his discovery as follows: "The great light of my forty-foot telescope was so useful that on the 17th of September, 1789, I remarked the seventh satellite, then situated at its greatest western elongation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mimas is named after one of the Giants in Greek mythology, Mimas. The names of all seven then-known satellites of Saturn, including Mimas, were suggested by William Herschel''s son John in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope. He named them after Titans specifically because Saturn (the Roman equivalent of Cronus in Greek mythology), was the leader of the Titans and ruler of the world for some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surface area of Mimas is slightly less than the land area of Spain. The low density of Mimas, 1.15 g/cm³, indicates that it is composed mostly of water ice with only a small amount of rock. Due to the tidal forces acting on it, Mimas is noticeably prolate; its longest axis is about 10% longer than the shortest. The ellipsoidal shape of Mimas is especially noticeable in some recent images from the Cassini probe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mimas''s most distinctive feature is a giant impact crater 130 kilometres (81 mi) across, named Herschel after the discoverer of Mimas. Herschel''s diameter is almost a third of Mimas''s own diameter; its walls are approximately 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) high, parts of its floor measure 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) deep, and its central peak rises 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) above the crater floor. If there were a crater of an equivalent scale on Earth it would be over 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi) in diameter, wider than Australia. The impact that made this crater must have nearly shattered Mimas: fractures can be seen on the opposite side of Mimas that may have been created by shock waves from the impact travelling through Mimas''s body.</p>', 'Saturn', 198.2, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/57-r_jgKU8HaVTbzT0tZnj-D2Uiq7HQsNppo4PGqzRH9JpfYp2V6HLKvrrvxZDHwPotZsDKn54v6xTS-rClwkNnqgyDlpaH-xAR72xg3JhQqDuDWgLfBO1Nh55swxZKZI4EFw5YfVPi0aR4CmMUSMFhZsoxXsCJsGUfnWA90hwKcnf_zfzqXP-fpkaZOjSkFpwfoUZnM0sxNgDAbwdGcmsyb6HBrJHQAiYjiT91cgGF9eXrVC6wM2oZKOwRsOFtnJA5Qf4eqeUQM8t81sa1BUexNeMpbtEcqr2wF7RCm8qB77YnfBvvJXAzIYSP4aeKcU0gKaNq2dWIP0g8csQOUvTo7C8DOB735vJUjlUad8Zm6FvGXVgDy_iL8nQkLVrUhZWXR_VQCiHSkTgAhUmR-_j6PtiXEjg19SnwpmNdsy370P_j8l0O8EITsT8HtscfO3dYgPHtbRJTg7fNbpOvaWU_a_GXvfTvFn_9mFNAhGUrTyoAL3M18GE952GH2t341YZV3v34Txz1jDEzq95I9AIh908YfEM148HPG4o3-uJo=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sDU9jbBFbdjO8l0c2WQOr2UA1zN6FVagXNm0JdydoeiOlnbqAAILqJikE8SvgCwJpck7Kt7BR3wRmH9YB8tPubqtxp1ooT1zAoCz2p0x0FwWJwq3tPhcVn4qs4aQtOm3qj0mHlErWBMH2A0C3BE4Bc1OIdjNH9R337lVn3VWXkjJMYooVc94foFzm5MMpqcS7V8Bo39w1hP8CtgqOsEhdyzLNUt4Ifyh6htNHWGk9mNcm1Win2m29Q9Lo_ySA_L0VnXo8Qe5aZGiG5Lm5FcdcLjj2cmThGjzOShCCqjhpnaErabtpYDBj-DejrOQdie7B_saEaHJkbpPVVdVzi-N9bKUIWMNxUFUQGgwNOgbq2gKBlFwbHssLn0mNonX6Xhmo6e4EuWtpNh-XdSatOyEobUFquAP9tGiinUqJQALx-CoR7aKGdGIR9KDfrlk8ZHMz9HQtW5NJH7KJr7KogDfMd6AcHV0bxGQRmYBaYk3CZL_1N_HD94oX9l5E0YpE_ZY6z__B47C1wzhav_MA5wsr-1bYtwf0ZO-mIRF7MffNTk=s799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/k9-6HU-URy5-xhDN-ATd2VfztL0A7k0QqnYYS3O7UvcAq0i3fIGX5OK7BGLeJIHWWXAufUdO86j9PuFSUEuUcUMVRLSacOMQxCHfASsNHTvNBDDUpGIR7we57sO1s3SX9KQSXe3k186KHnx4qcCEZXh0DNIhXviF_J93ymiSEO6rJTaRndicHUiWaPiRkhBmt6FoDlFGapFhDCnVNBElG3w1ScZQ-Q8yzj8I85f8TNMD3Nfr-BDoHjJiZ8_GiJROwcSUCb4meD5AikW4xEwR7uy6BLOEMf2lEVIokAQxL5AvMCE1y1f6f8HY9vUWuGMd70jpaD9Cg9DJdixGbWfI0u0ooK4JJkunt5fTjcTXU4T83b231wBlkygBfewo7AYfEx94Qe2fY1W7uw8UQqQD6O51woXQkPdcjDyizruexU25KdA9_DfQdMHDqTQlYfAoEi0RGtUaoS_FfhrbPrEYJG_OOlUbl6uC8MJUehgHxXpd9fofGrpWaaV8cPZSxrt60KcNdeAUAYfj0niAdkGToW8CnfyLMlnSipP86_u4NjY=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Rjv70TTI3mgBNQ9zDKGrgVKbRmuc8-TelMWBdmgHs0NTesS2fcb8c7-Qx06sBg1OmfUE0ZPRm7UkBFzfaRrPgDeNZNMyfxgvAMrHZ8Bjd5TIHjNo2469ysrPpD7kgxVzeGJhhg2jZLaX3Ag9aVfW0pE16g3gTWRcf4T8LsCX7dwWC34Th2xkugQMDMHGD8fpnpSkRc1y9A6QyzJe8q_OXqhDEE_keOepMejq6iZt9jr47wgNcOXw1aeDAC4O0lQRZlrOiFUsdVMk70Z4sSybS_f-7nr8HIP448v3DdIpKHlJy1D1GhkEZ7hgLnAOZzwoHjE1kMwEqyy8MkHmLJEEvSs26PwrolwCGejowEHbjuGipA8CqGWUvrxX1piHTBw8tvT_r8z4-r_q5OGGidfZt0G-2ERcCaS82kAvLUpYv06cJ0MVzNtj_4NMQxnDgkSnRL5eImpI_bAuTSyxFi-7AeXnjNn1UDnDTk_B2yv_SBFrE0hafGzxEOGPSiQa3ZvpBrLCpIn9pxBs7ASjHqJSRkOwDwr0BUzFjAyW043UxBY=w278-h156-no'),
(13, 'Proteus', 51, 'Proteus (/ˈproʊtiːəs/;[e] Greek: Πρωτεύς), also known as Neptune VIII, is the second largest Neptunian moon, and Neptune''s largest inner satellite. Discovered by Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, it is named after Proteus, the shape-changing sea god of Greek mythology. Proteus circles Neptune in a nearly equatorial orbit at the distance of about 4.75 equatorial radii of the planet.\r\n\r\n<p>Despite being more than 400 km in diameter Proteus has a somewhat irregular shape with several slightly concave facets and relief as high as 20 km. Its surface is dark, neutral in color and heavily cratered. The largest crater is more than 200 km in diameter. There are also a number of scarps, grooves and valleys related to large craters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proteus is probably not an original body that formed with Neptune; it may have accreted later from the debris created when the largest Neptunian satellite Triton was captured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proteus was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 space probe two months before its Neptune flyby in August 1989. It received the temporary designation S/1989 N 1. Stephen P. Synnott and Bradford A. Smith announced its discovery on July 7, 1989, speaking only of "17 frames taken over 21 days", which gives a discovery date of sometime before June 16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 16 September 1991 S/1989 N 1 was named after Proteus, the shape-changing sea god of Greek mythology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proteus orbits Neptune at the distance approximately equal to 4.75 equatorial radii of the planet. Its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined by about 0.5° to the planet''s equator. Proteus is the largest of the regular prograde satellites of Neptune.

(14, 'Triton', 38, 'Triton is the largest moon of the planet Neptune. It was discovered on October 10, 1846, by English astronomer William Lassell. It is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit, an orbit in the opposite direction to its planet''s rotation. At 2,700 kilometres (1,700 mi) in diameter, it is the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System. Because of its retrograde orbit and composition similar to Pluto''s, Triton is thought to have been captured from the Kuiper belt. Triton has a surface of mostly frozen nitrogen, a mostly water-ice crust, an icy mantle and a substantial core of rock and metal. The core makes up two-thirds of its total mass. Triton has a mean density of 2.061 grams per cubic centimetre (0.0745 lb/cu in) and is composed of approximately 15–35% water ice.\r\n\r\n<p>Triton is one of the few moons in the Solar System known to be geologically active. As a consequence, its surface is relatively young, with a complex geological history revealed in intricate cryovolcanic and tectonic terrains. Part of its crust is dotted with geysers thought to erupt nitrogen. Triton has a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere less than 1/70,000 the pressure of Earth''s atmosphere at sea level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Triton was discovered by British astronomer William Lassell on October 10, 1846, just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A brewer by trade, Lassell began making mirrors for his amateur telescope in 1820. When John Herschel received news of Neptune''s discovery, he wrote to Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also claimed to have discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they are so faint and dark that it is doubtful that he actually saw them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Triton is named after the Greek sea god Triton (Τρίτων), the son of Poseidon (the Greek god comparable to the Roman Neptune). The name was first proposed by Camille Flammarion in his 1880 book Astronomie Populaire, and was officially adopted many decades later. Until the discovery of the second moon Nereid in 1949, Triton was commonly referred to as "the satellite of Neptune". Lassell did not name his own discovery; he later successfully suggested the name Hyperion, previously chosen by John Herschel, for the eighth moon of Saturn when he discovered it.</p>', 'Neptune', 1353.4, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AEXR9G8UbMxSBAwhfFA1bZe9nIw34LELjys5ALwx4_Q1Z9zhvVoZIM9WcnulVhbcrBSrpch_jnOzoaUxwxGTrZ809lHQj7JmvDECA7W5KblVp6G0pwwkmBPki0JigKJe-oZXnTw0HG2uX1CmETlBcDPbIsU1kGgQnK37IcNGFc5BT1dvGx2B9pFjOSF8SV2RVfzMYQ0wCxnfZU8Rt1Ch24rRGMgfGnR2Nh67Kv1kI1qF9OtPOPZPI104v6yMv9CiGv08NmlNbhhoiPtRsVi5IvLUNVORk_UvFFHsTtt-KOqB6D3azUQcECtLtT4qiylZ5dhQw9TK8YRZYsYAWIB9kSs-fBCwtHuls_i8H-YMwPV_ZIhfvfaIlKR2eUx0JZKl2y1Tm4FJh4LxhWLKJ75GnKbcVgtJwN6paK1tQULoP0SVkbtbB76gcYgKS40fr7hJKzt5LaC1uDxZTiMhZgF9vU3vR2e6-l48aKjLYNJM107xmKGkjBHG8s0vqIJmfvaMQeLJk0p28cfFc3Hf81lAYOr2zBIai-WhqtJB5ZMK2UA=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bU7UQFYDoOnPKOZZxZ-1Du8bJFn0tdMGjbFfK2ZcfgGRxP6OoeDAXoFiFMYm_HIkuxwOtjxadtV3woncTLVJxH3nDs8j__XLFoUOHMTNipo678H2m4b4MhmDQVpXfoFNXSTBxcqtjI2RXfBZF8oha2cchm8ZvPj2Q2_IZq1ndjI9g7VEBPq4txe-KE-NlUwWB3TfedXjX1s9NU2fkOFsX4J8YCuQ4rUvqa9ef-Ing3Rdblo96VftEEW1e9-miM3_U6W-Afbo0f0WRVoVM-Y9O_JEaym2AJ-S92jiTa8dsPqXPbmL6fxTgvKbrYce4-aAu2WF9_SOnCfyqogF3f7mUx3nJKVIQbDjuKbFU3UWjD6M9lBQTVF-jYBucJgPLfziWrpxCLfC1EgNILZDDIQqJ03zPQMqyV3ut3_0t8N2Fu-6zEA37vIUhAu55VKJklgJrP70I4JlTTNlk1hdgResgJ5czvuEEBtJ5jSVOLiI7Fg_RCtdSplh5hicGjVS1dXT2OfssY6Sw1dA-n0xbSLD0XvRr3CEOOjod-ykwRFu53s=w986-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/60h1DP-TxAbKG7dspOrOn_CPiti-zpOImq9qyBAUCozin82UtV3yT5hqTFWnQdDV6uPdbi-loFAe9j7ocfUlXcTf7ZfGns0bl0q05oNu8_MFkA6pRTvPjZ_l9qW7DRWgy8sze-23aJI717hIdPNZJ2kL4QDEmZN9qMcPCjpfIih0DszstCI7dj3WfSBXpqSxduDSoau5uCvLLVVgSylRo1alTghm1rTr-wX6thiME4Nu1pgZVadFlg2X3CBscm6mOZtCMT3QrOWDvWbsbA7lZKI4UAOzuwHh96sxFhm9TRxK50Q8lkGmfUc421-B0nY3YQSdVg0XdTS4fEk3uQadWmrbqZcC7TGH14QGtPeaSqu5sgQsPGBkBLy6tSCUCLkYg6ZK-vomtfajYAgOMflqF1sAEJxh8whV_XrA-ezwAmH__PKb3cvVc_sTbOLYdGF5Fwwv5wT7jKjLfyGSBKeeVEy8ZyaEty6HxxAys70xBHMCB2MjcjffEejGoo4n-Cq25PQ0pGcpS-0Z9yGxQ8N1mBeFXZZ5EzJA-uHWe2xl2aE=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oyF3Ajd8sh-XC3VVUz8NsSW2S4IwO_8JE_wNkw52Urih7H-qTGjuConArWN66_aCR9yJnlOWiJek9wrUq8o06qHZW-erBM0Tq45MkIhVQ9lgUyvmfe8OxhCs2VMw_68js4QIxp7GR31A66ULTPz-EUYKGN9eNM8g4Yl0c4EwhANZ8E0Wmtu_YUm2aAytp6CH7aDwf5XBHDbql5rMpnUYpBjvoLd7Lj2vrNs8Oa7y9YjWxhAWKzFLmkZ3Q44Rn4MFYyFfDFDtGnbqSwWvyUjDQI6z29TzyMBuHOZVwbwEHI7HJhdUUWIG9Xn9l_Mf3Yju1H49exTPCFe7GYzyprY0G8--KFKbJwnGQ-PCfSvitbl5JIuHOCM3Lkqn4X6XRJV6-lPnL2Na1EURMPLtRYiGN81x6N96ffCy51ZDPX926pStzH1WrDgY5pykWW9CeluCBAnVx3hyO53k2cp9xi2zMkmCe2cAu5MEwM44mcEPEnJY08tw0tgylGv0sRzz3SxCowuoURci9s2WirR9Jpz-pW9wAH-Iy70kK5D1PZQuhiA=w278-h156-no');

(1, 'Solar System', 'The Solar System comprises the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets that form the planetary system around it, while the remainder are significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies such as comets and asteroids. Of those that orbit the Sun indirectly, two are larger than the smallest planet.\r\n\r\n<p>The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system''s mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed largely of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called ices, such as water, ammonia and methane. All planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies between Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune''s orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations are several dozen to possibly tens of thousands of objects large enough to have been rounded by their own gravity. Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified dwarf planets include the asteroid Ceres and the trans-Neptunian objects Pluto and Eris. In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, at least three of the dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, usually termed "moons" after Earth''s Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solar wind, plasma flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of interstellar wind; it extends out to the edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is believed to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vYfKIoqfVtWOGzECn5iEGW1srZD7uro2_sCrli4pSCki0CKMAjeXD2AG3G_t2O-wcEKbdn5vwsqyuhPm_chk599Ms3WbRCnI3YnJh1ZpVhG-aqfQjzkf6jC8Q-Edx370hy6_wP3sq-FIBCeFlJPFQkgtvILEu60YJtp9h4puupelRKLoMDJh1RQf_aGHpkhQrLgaT1ZfBFV198vjdm-UpuumZlsef1h3wqIawT3FqHQCCVWmkidd-asQCEOGYjzRSF7sv8ccXxS3-YwfwLUZj-wuEFdtNmuSUjpYmtxtwCLcv6vk0-QdsxDvYQcl6plLWymxop6QwCqe0TnMUA2PLzpXe50i-leCCATiqvHarvWDbrE1gRvHonl3MpAa3thajNbydBe8MeEVrN_kSVX2ykS5aKbtvncFvKmmfDd0zZ8qoMS3uub0-7RfN1tO9xLy7RJLGYdRM8ax6gb-e-Wdk6C19JY9E-GCsmIRwWvryb076lNt7xq_mRkMQ56VDe_2utsn1SOThNUQKki1kb0YTspR_wM1uszDMrJHIIQHS9E=w1047-h618-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9XvTP0Eyfe3joBFa1PKqUPAAA-odPeiKXzaR60JKyk2OzGS1t2ZpGBkivnLF-J2f0K8Lb56CQPj_j1wLtNb0s_8WUdbHuVWaXfaai9L6Ycj5w16GO3oUxTXYyVlMMTPhfoGg58gAyTrmVz47k2slKDQ_ha5SjRC4SSgqshk8vFbtR-97F7DwrJh-p_UDP54KIUEvimr2qzwWFWpF4oWNuhjHcYqWW2cQ4mUNw5dABZ_DgK03r5UDS-IiqK2V-a1_wI8HAyPBX4DRrQ6WLDE5TzioORV3K-H4UDmfn-diUe31F28iEsoeyaqc3lrGiSB_fhdzborpSMYPEHB8-JsOosITt2VF_lbWvYnT9R5C01xgqHL1nlS_szkD0WbwmIBZM8cax0zBbYDB3bcYoFiuwHKqeKFm1j4PlWfW9PNL6PEGZ-Opv17o5wQh1HynTHdVZ2U_e_UVzx5yXXjuLDBF8glsn-XzXyY_vGLZgmn4YBQxkenNk1pFJYcAM3dZDJ9-HPakGOpBnfXjZX8DPRdeFA100CZ0KWo8X0XfFGNLaD4=w640-h487-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MclC0Y0CtAD271Mqq9wu-t9LKeTPl0uYs4IQxUwsHUolT0jLCC8R1A78W-7AZfS814gHgM1mDhK3KgzCUrY0pdynL1gWnBbts_MuuYabuZf8lUDA574M9V899pMMDFAZIPJDB7-xbTqmZwg95J8evgjHb2lyoVy1liK4fU0_cZY-StMVvwccMdasEUfByDlN9fdaTLocAn6Bb1eAG-_XAscdGEx1ytWKi9etSymJ4rD8ZpKE_Yn8asZbolwYM6sISPjn3I5sw5w5vmx3eWMY5y63JkyYKgVEIvavwxz5ieDlGGA4VCZ73fZjsHwtCQuiOlToURtwLx0Ed8xULMeL__qCtNlCploB0Uo_eK2gG7rMwbM_a3T4fPCvOsr4N4yyG4EabfAKSFpdcI1FqP9Mv8lcgh0AAZhIZ-No2Czikt0QjG7jxLw54nDzheuiWtUmEgO7uj1S8JG7wOwFpkG1Y-cwXLYBUy_416i3T6WyWk9QHSGModl-1IcRXZyk7nK2BWfYKCmr989Nqb1p_JOxksqckUA6NUApfAMJ9HUI0EE=w480-h360-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-m1R58v5_3q8jippEsaflYcGYJq3xS_51ubYWZF-sdbRhPgyoR_hpijQMo3xK7vqeo1FP2OXM0mJwoNsZVKtIHUm2I7KbPQ1SpOhtBNcUBTbe4JlE0s-aG7cWWK7xsxQRYiNs238AUJmqdc03LR8d7PygMxFLWaE5fe6j6EG0l1iHOA71D-6hbHTF30yMfcTJiet-89HEDf9bKLyom-MaIt-frwnqcnMNa8MS6v3QrpecSnVEcqP6cl7GVf_VLQaPhlAHaCAZM_PY079jao6vZht4_dAyYLi3md1tfCrW94VhuTqVTOiYHkhGZECxW6m_LgTwnL5iELd3YNcBDGhwEM9XG_wM0Sxy6oZLt5HuuickvXPVrxXMAJSUrK5pe1JQew9JPI_oM1CqGYn5u8L-QOM_RorIsf7ytoUzazBmCm9-vYnycvOF4JnSrMbMcAOApJumNM_IARtgdYhpjfvodMy--YvdWM1lvnAWUn9FvUKIlfOzNUWtz8sYZBmjodgAMpKqWP2CKbVdd4QDiEF1g8SnJknGJKx4r_F8L__eRg=w1600-h532-no');

(1, 'Sun', 150000000, 696342, '', 'The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System and is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. It is a nearly perfect spherical ball of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and it has a mass about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Chemically, about three quarters of the Sun''s mass consists of hydrogen, whereas the rest is mostly helium, and much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.\r\n\r\n<p>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on spectral class and it is informally referred to as a yellow dwarf. It formed approximately 4.567 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became increasingly hot and dense, eventually initiating thermonuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process. The Sun is roughly middle age and has not changed dramatically for four billion years, and will remain fairly stable for four billion more. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo severe changes and become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The enormous effect of the Sun on the Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. Earth''s movement around the Sun is the basis of the solar calendar, which is the predominant calendar in use today.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P10ww11M1OtFWoExXrhcw3KG54GAl8hiFZG_A41zJsD__jg00xThpNuBgy7Pb0PH824LJOXfgHhXRp6UF9YeyQOlkALn_eHEMPA1vfazzwZQr90G8vGiAgp8BNLHhK09EQekuVIMnrMDvFEJsDwfpdVp2qD1R-Meol_J3pz868VBYOQM5QKFROkrogm46IKU2yQjaRlYWNVFoks0athsNY9rfx-3vr6pD2yBLYQnlin0B6NKmVyuotFTCWM26TwK9hazbEH0v5j8Aq55kc9LckvYqDFVghHKW1gkPOapFPI-nKU0s_1cH6_tSE4N8nXRbFUjPkYifJuF_wuBqGalR8kgkFeOgSwh9O21UILaAZK7FatUyejQLuL1C9oRL0yiqzDsNUmv-qqk6PyKyZRXQYT1H5vvTkxb8Yg2HZkpv-f5BuwWwvYMeSmLW9F7Z-TA-PvYZRpXmOVSTkXKKDdUiyQYghHJg8VVsvQF9Qq01f2CaFYvbVqEcf1fHRrLLce87pC30lGgc3v8k9L82y2hBn2DSvezWFDGI6jXS0_1RVQ=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wD2U3i0EBmTwodYB2qFZI2Me5bnALB2uQm-QqEgUQWzg2HVw06XFL-qhuKFwPZZsFHPItXPb8JAMeVD9vOYapz7Xoxc9MKl2ADBrDTohDv3EZ8O4_Ks69UcJORh46LEA08RNc9C_ouXhlAazWGUieX4mFfE2netZD64Yxi4C3CdF8EDzi1rotEdh6ZUY9bP551ogC0KnSgUCnMav_lihGT8uM8BPTVJ6ZnCuviKA-bLQf1tnvnIJJCe8G6Q_zpi1iD9SIM0Q3aHQ6bRFu-588nDTEzzLvn8z0dG23jjXmzeAb4ckrpr_JZztq36nPuPGtwvVvBW-ZqwzzrobpQQECMw057LuhIstXjKKwZ4-_ftHfEwRcNt-nsNfheHsgkabn6hoKkBCMSdHWGhxHJhbSsSN6Q1Q51y0R39SwkIZBLmqRgw64wZcwp_qNYALtU-kyt11R0YUqwjukNs9Eq_TssUpHNocR1epvUnk10GeQ7fr430oUKOI23Q3y9FY226aldlXE27pbxFG7RMxcfNhPbUoH4_Pse13rYv68oKhlGU=w640-h360-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qyrn8ADCSRjVQp-zAkI5tkQh0wu8QQADzrpwmd3JnGMbS22zDgIDXMlX0gd7WC5AKPpxRXNWRozRzVNgM8144r05e_FfSz3Ya3Uu6mi1p0TQrZuY_n_8muf3g-AZ0cjUUqkfNdxnWniIMHb6b-6ilc80FuO1tUno1mIvPO8dy_7rCdkOnfBgdVJtF1cgrDX1QKBbaAZk8sHBcX424H9inpdu7yt0yBK-AL-7_p9aYBkut_GqBa_3UrFvdM0CzVYTumKuqkHtgs15De_teULCgnyIy95POa1EqeEgkQVb_Xw2kM7hpuYg69FItumY9NYPlfEDN0Ygo182AOSFVkfOONQkf3lmyR0NO6zQboQhzJ_KVbL3mnESxoiGZujntU9eoOoddCArD_iHT7TekbRXgL4lnY06jOWEYulgg0ITiIRhNX3WChCBUOmiNu4SUPpDNZLD2dhLODtR_6XVgCKFMSxhhb-Pr-auB_C0vGbb2j2ZRL_q6nWyeCJxBYXj9P2lhuuAkk3sBCeG-Ebizo10qi4hMvhn2ELvjcaverY0-Yo=w1421-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5aQ7YYORKf_Gtr2F8UxYaPCtqqw3zWTl342s2b4eZeBO5tSX6KXDDWkyvhypBR3C7vwRrcdKyP_4-Q20ems_HoUuQpeExrcOUKwC9C9quqveu4BAQhJaPVROWuvw5Mh1qjniCqta1TiCPOd4ejC2IWeHK5_oMyho99WPuadbTF98-Wr_nXJRd0nrApP3Cx3m9WSJRA6EJrE_-QCxeXt-XM4KTjCq1Fd8u_Xl8WCbrXLrUnGsrvlVjyhHEN-jhkJXYe_YMWWoQk84fSvyVnlmjtULgRN80YoQPKXLsyCCNB4LttGxCLqgI8TJ22hcTXXvpgzR2dATGuzvV1l0o2Biw6Dm8cd6Ho15MW4A69L1HwUa8aXe59DyKticphaTFkVq4UipKwH4ydcWuvHHFqrqkYpWT1sy52ewES67MShGVovC7yYRZ_MpgmNuG5PvUFFfOkt_Pdq3o9xOwsPFXSjk89kIMk2U6j5srrfrvZN57_xtoOSpwRtaJDugSS2bP_JcFSdsPZt3N94rwjT7Ty7yr1b2L4_HEI639woAUZ7IW5k=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fFMZasKq7chhF55VzjqkFGNCwrsiunPMZPDf5VAE0Yp-TKSNGmE_0rJExMZw8m_dO7OPUuNo_nJoUH-tWF_Ca7SKCZ2qYawnpigYTxQ1DhrEUxFMT8j11K-lkwUlgay4jmM0GePJQJxP-PcPSuhqM9st9cjveLoqBT7NFU5JgiAACy_P-mXInbz_63JePcYvic4xUHW2y786U4TtUI4KEcX3kHTSODPQj1C10nwdOQyXaEEwY72wYxnZ5qBDEwQI4i0j0rZf0aUak0pLepK1CSDZ53JjU65jvwzzLT9DYZkRZe84JMSN3Jn_RVHeLzogm04eOKV7x3sNqvK-smsgSql3RSHMCg-gxpBDWJyiU_VO4kUjgX7ku4F35nNXYrxntRgPRN7gteK8sr1Z8hmu14cTsKsOra2f3JRhLU6VY8hmIP0tNlABiqS7vgGHCbAnB4SyVFEnfyti2oZSAZnj7uNgqxsb24LgEM4STXswoZBV_D3l1Q_1lBAMTuaMUciu0vn3StuBJ16RpYXjk5vaonXvFiJE-OZ36jSOB9NIeME=w278-h156-no'),
(2, 'Sirius', 8.6, 1.711, 'Canis Major', 'Sirius (/ˈsɪriəs/) is the brightest star (in fact, a star system) in the Earth''s night sky. With a visual apparent magnitude of −1.46, it is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star. The name "Sirius" is derived from the Ancient Greek: Σείριος Seirios ("glowing" or "scorcher"). The system has the Bayer designation Alpha Canis Majoris (α CMa). What the naked eye perceives as a single star is actually a binary star system, consisting of a white main-sequence star of spectral type A1V, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, called Sirius B. The distance separating Sirius A from its companion varies between 8.2 and 31.5 AU.\r\n\r\n<p>Sirius appears bright because of both its intrinsic luminosity and its proximity to Earth. At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), as determined by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth''s near neighbors. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth''s sky for the next 210,000 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun (M<sub>☉</sub>) and has an absolute visual magnitude of 1.42. It is 25 times more luminous than the Sun but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus or Rigel. The system is between 200 and 300 million years old. It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars. The more massive of these, Sirius B, consumed its resources and became a red giant before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white dwarf around 120 million years ago.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sirius is also known colloquially as the "Dog Star", reflecting its prominence in its constellation, Canis Major (Greater Dog). The heliacal rising of Sirius marked the flooding of the Nile in Ancient Egypt and the "dog days" of summer for the ancient Greeks, while to the Polynesians in the southern hemisphere it marked winter and was an important star for navigation around the Pacific Ocean.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ISZs0axmVkLsT5UDuXPpgvXFaW9SqWOYJlS5aLtG6UCg-zhczI5j5qCiwLsLz_gk3tzcAymmsoo0F5035MlnqweewY9j2GAx_994kYkcnoJE4aBJYhGRDU2BZaxAkPkhYD7R7Pj6PA92NLkFA2R23H8EEmNupj9-w33puqd5KfAerH37rNnt_6UjfR2rtaRQcQg-P5vZ-Ow7jcDyMo6kw0XwDrX_C-j9FdjTgM_ZgHxsaoSSJKH5wlKc6vphATTUzhvN4dMw9f-aERtetqU70kKtNfU9VOdpPNMf_CHwgpczKuRe2vATfRuQIaV87jovWqVPkuPHvcfdzIfCuDlwfVDqt4PIFZwGxriacHkz9-RSXoElQ7T5N-56B4qOIpPa8863rYR0tgKOA_elcxDyCVoCUGcMIiGr914kQs5Oauib0p_j_4OI1dko9MjKRYCdVHDW9kU0NZ-cBNl7J0i_PEZdRq73ZmrTSAKXaxHR3zPdGR2SBzQCFl7XlE-ARQvvL8kUjTJalkwd77cpAMFVlcf8phyn5OeRB7fZYMEnPFY=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q6qvCV2IIGmZcWoTXnLmd-PLvC9-D5jQYFiN8cSVOIX_O3g4fF46xYPok08XokTc1d-uAhHxBpbwNXEjdc6oQEBn03EuRb64o44q3I3Tt7wJ5AP5WDckpCpciwJ_nKRodcDsvoDdlg_HApcXtb3e14zo_b90Q4JZlECJwXigQWTyGOYxGH6JSmJ_fC9qElIZVo5ozRhKlhXYI0OQSJQ1v5-X2joDIx3Pjlr8eTbISgxddQwjyAqlqwbZAS_PgMJ8SSZHcmQh3OC2aNt1DzzVukDWl2qaGiGqkWEQsSvmnn4OdL_rigjKlh6W7CLrwoPyqUMpzFGPn4X7qm55ZGUlpfgAvSQpAXw9oWqPJi3TDyVMrGj-PAODiWWO_PEULUbH0GiAQnT4Kv5yJRMMoMs5W0mGKIG0OkX1okMSCFzEkIQ28fXnIKvp_KpByXbSwkoR8X736lTDYUpGsK7xgq3KhfnWuFyTCTDPVjA3C5tLrhmb9jwfuXJHeOHNDeu3pL775TJ39FxGjn7d-1ErJc-7gRazW0z5Rrw4pdHgc2qgbws=w369-h403-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PGwTSwJEl3IcmxsFiGEpeByrY5yUrm6_bO0tTEvscXZn7hzOlSaUlDiWpTZ4FVt1EWEd0mxV46eytM0rbKjTDRRYJZ8YCbsivGpCadl_7Twz4raFUlVJ87F8fvE3Tf_ADC-YyKdloRvQTD2VnHDn-g73cwn6cgCtdwVnT0Mi9Zozy3lz7uqYq04rE8N12-Tpa6pIGKQBTYBVjoZF8L6X2fwT1npACFYlx4mtnaM_36UseORkKumOmuBlGYB8W3VAh0fC0gh90-wqyUE23DtGqL2Kxf-yWoNt-JaBlRs_a07e7TCjsQJSEWzZHGEDwiAgqHZWgV5Y7lx0jkA-CxuFlaprfPDhBt2GPHL5BLfHY_qKefHaOkjqXWaaNW1b9fAf__TDMiHtJVm6U0zq5ib0RpImRriYo3RukUKzEpj-V5pqjuM2tHRLjBOyXtDpzBIwUeFyUNcIMOVwZetJXWQ8p3fnckfzDuG7UrgzoZ18tD31YqDg4cB1vPk6pJ0IADgm0pK3y7GEouAr9O8jd7GL6ajrQPRCx0y-cVluMJQKtfM=w1066-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pK5Q4fK1E-rehIDItIODRxHFHhwvcSX7H0CLVAP5JUerZosB3d2J_1ttwvRCmTvNDrcYxJKapDrXGEhFq4JqChUpBB9aaPAMMx35VXrK8XiQS2k0Ii1UuoctBB1BMfWE1wi2ixC-eKUDgpabWWc-Z052u0MSuFQg_10QmfhtppWaEBMeF4hSHIpreOlNbvKc6p2Zf820xtZJ3U_kuMg9pxu3jdeFd_Jd-EJyIO5keCEH0pxl-AqlLlH5jNedsfNXFCLKcWPOi0GgfzKxKsIKFn6CzrG5ds8SUg4HFgq7XegtaKyeQWpxjGsUTF6ak9Z5TmZyIr7ePBeTq9DttrRVtQcsRXVfLQW8Et2nGE_bvOTD03MmpOJZ3-LM3874f6uYpmgPTFaeKQB2tzXvyYtQN4bX90ji1dGOhGNwODRQDr-BKKX-qU6GOXJ6UM0w2qOEhJEX8A-mqPKJlGNAS128G8eUhwFCqChLFqZaLwHlZ-FLFfYktnBHIz2NpLYzOyZnzeGVN1VHXMIZsaeBtme_ORMIcPo8QST4NWasjjzjMPs=w369-h208-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mA-Tr221EJuHktLLh2bFArUttskCYk47G3MK9XQKxr8e7JSKz3g4jGh7BbhtMDE73f9osKOFYAbEBAfcV7VjTXmIS7GIFXdgG8IUgXjsAuS3Y7WK_P9ce2QIQxoyPE7ZiMrNPjs6x398P75FU4mCGDRNbMM7qn57998ccHtFTU_8lFHgfqXzObv54Fig63z3nLQROHgfdTTvv-OlBa3dFhV1H_6SVjPGSyEsiecwDBs_T3ORT_9-TtY0Kxk1eWuGN7tfyZy0Sxcut_0Q3ie0AOhgc9KayPavxFrwC32HIOuivpNnZD2TlBaBE018j_XN2PTuGOiUKNJBcbkW5pJysh3cBP7yUA8vcwBC_3zv0OVylvAURL5SBZsJ3f8amoPXq65XbRQHNL3cRnunrWmRgyad8VCLKC4F0XuaShb7Tn1f8gDBLP-8onpf9qIaAf37EvSSWFTPVUGYW5uAYrlckw8Rq-P4TF9qpFJwDuRkbBF8WMeFJVPtPw4QOd6TaOsKg-aBEZi1LMhnTA6NzTbJCxco_rtZOBU0pd9Zeb-RD-s=w278-h156-no'),
(3, 'Antares', 550, 883, 'Scorpius', 'Antares, (/ænˈtɑːriːz/) also known by its Bayer designation Alpha Scorpii (abbreviated to α Scorpii or α Sco), is the seventeenth brightest star in the nighttime sky and the brightest star in the constellation Scorpius, and is often referred to as "the heart of the scorpion". Along with Aldebaran, Regulus, and Fomalhaut, Antares comprises the group known as the ''Royal stars of Persia''. It is one of the four brightest stars near the ecliptic.\r\n\r\n<p>Distinctly reddish when viewed with the unaided eye, Antares is a red supergiant of spectral type M0.5Iab and is one of the largest and most luminous observable stars. It is a slow irregular variable star with an average magnitude of +1.09. Antares is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest OB association (the Scorpius-Centaurus Association). Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, which contains thousands of stars with mean age 11 million years at a distance of approximately 145 parsecs (470 light years).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antares is a supergiant star with a stellar classification of M0.5Iab. With a radius that is approximately 883 times that of the Sun, if placed in the center of our Solar System, its outer surface would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Based upon parallax measurements, Antares is approximately 550 light-years (170 parsecs) from the Earth. Its visual luminosity is about 10,000 times that of the Sun, but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the infrared part of the spectrum, the bolometric luminosity equals roughly 65,000 times that of the Sun. The mass of the star has been calculated to be in the range of 15 to 18 solar masses. A recent analysis comparing the effective temperature and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars which include rotation and mass loss yielded a mass of approximately 17 solar masses and age of 12 million years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>he size of Antares may be calculated using its parallax and angular diameter. The parallax angle is given in the box to the right, and the angular diameter is known from lunar occultation measurements (41.3 ± 0.1 mas). This implies a radius of 890 ± 150 solar radii at this distance. By analysing its radial velocity from its spectrum, Pugh and colleagues calculated a period of 5.93 ± 0.01 years and considered whether this change was orbital or pulsational. If the latter, then the radius of the star changes by 165 ± 22 solar radii (19% ± 4%). However, if this were the case, Antares'' brightness would vary by a greater amount.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8teVZUSJAWimSDi6TQ7cw48JFxXgsL70fxSMPhl7GjRpHDgQitvi1IRqS6l4fN9kpYz_tP6avar3OQVjYR04u79VfKb7r75PvulTZpnJVpKZbybEaOYxd9LLhHEv1Ya2EEUVjbtKSkD9bT2F0yBJI4N61CDBMx-YPUayRqWV_Cs-M80SCFXIxxj1DQBOn7jiOuCpK2A5XA9idBnQ7DngHMnRHbVhWcra4nXQpYSGGyX5vOFB1oWCTvPY9Kl1mpZzfCH7U3Fu6qOq_DBrQAxLik2bazDuiHXf5G6YKHs97g78ND4I8KA2a3VaM9wsPl5VrtKFE5oBU3YzWLJ7NfwN3hP7x0yfaEVOZ4ocn6YOEs8jJpI_G4qvvvrwtHcYP6RMJ7uLvpbFck7efkLaJfgd7rQ4CnYRpRQ61OEjQb0uTuNVUMB-_lSciusHpbh0JKrSpze7o2gzvJsdoq9I681sGPcNehStM9i3791H2r1Deq2JrBogDzq70N37dxKdn2b720JYCIfA058xJMjfO8GxYnsB6JZeavjE6Df6BQUMsE0=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1Lk1zGVc-uAGC3jAyJI_W5S8ldVL5QaPbvTKx3XuRgCqmgis3XFGZe8n_HS3HKcypCbOP6gw3oc2-OoaC-aAOVmGhlYkX_E1P4ga9QDg_H-TfdUOhiAfyZAJt7B3hJ0V39KFwMVMRUaSEAP27z19oL6tPyQjicMsCQftLV2Mio79k2Yy1332MFHzYws-Bv4k0UFY36bjqWe_Ou3wYJ8MQm5Jcl9SnblaK-uh_GD5Ev7K-Tdmyi6dXqfIIBUGJvg1YdiwweFxFDuO1VRM8fufgaMe6leWhzpF_P6HHMd8wfOLan3Jy1IDtWwf1Edv0DCIwWIxd2jx-FojquiIkXhiLl_C5-gM03KIGkQbyIseaqJxo_8x2ZwCOjlh2nydveqMdCyi5Da2lXV-P3PJAHyV0K4nIz9YlB01q8SLrnkIKMDXYnFPsRTRHbZfwo74GWsIbmtdQO10pFUg8sIeXw3IB8Tk2BKdfDmaiQAfEJ61csVmtWt2zyYwR49lQcDlD0d3Q1f0_UKZankz0lEjtDMS35Yogsz4Bn67dRv8ej_k2Ro=s799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gBDTgCOmDK2_iJIy_YVrV3hOxYhjC4pbc47JNZU5RvXKLJO5CGhTmjY_VMTqO54rBpj2McZBc1bi_uxri2oaoVjCcKSDyMhATqaVEKAjGBOuYwb2t0pbEsj6MDW1YlGmQvVCLGEbJFDAjbipMxEFwvGq0-xNpBeNfdB6Ju2tmB6u3L2FXtdvlZs62Isfq6WTMsKk-JMAYBjI4DVfwVirZKfBpd0Ll0wgEvdwsIU5ahk80A5U4cD-ydPTANEcQ9kN4h4GIShvgKQO_chsKNKXIReBRH0DqnoTv9kXx_YiiLlMBOL_HsEbgWtn1-6blMsPbMujffwXHD6ZjDbG7_uW1x3-x9YNptAs_P8Z3nC6AAfl4KrdykES40oq6eW7_C6wKz4o11oiZFtDWkLOqzdtJe0-QRxmaJM8cbwJ0P1QPYcOhuE20fbjeULX41w7hOBnYm4XofuD5-U9fZ7qV201OT41d7jjztS1vyYEG66SfxgFVSxDB36DxdrRRr58ephZpzVBMmz9uyU3NIKSNzyI9E2zbNWnRW-gGMkdUjxdyvk=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/itXw1SuMdPuJTKGXHSIPFRx6xzr4IMvPHjdR7Q3Oq5qprqc1yzsFVMA06pZKUKOThuSH6dmnecZ2vTgThBr4YoXdVRKdOzlhGVvI7iOyw1D0Y3pNXs_kZBXvXhw10M1ulRH89byvUG8kI90i0YBXUScIuuf2kKo-MySfCDtHCFkk_sKuyhrguhqkuo5s-mqHPFbXwcFLsvm-1aR2GHYJUVsFvtXyuBgVrYTn2rgOVUIlAEb5p_eBngurT3DEirioQruPc5wYPr6Mx9JMJ451lmz3NFRzVjLF4Ww54oYLYBzII4dIxklSbm4vOMPA4wJzV1nbnsxJNb8YeDvVCWwUC32eb_bMcQB1x0ZHebySfls5Ppx9aVCoYWhpbBy8jvmcdlKEgNHIsiRosq7_-wOaZ37H9Nif8oMVAnQQrWSprFmlgune6EwNF--c4xNPGhkB8ur1f0hXW5exvGX8pNBvanITD9u4Ybyn54wForjacjK1YjZMHXwglbQc8jOKaA7KYWv967e_b-BUXLmULzdzspSN6fU8HX-JpQ5Wf_czcog=w278-h156-no'),
(4, 'Rigel', 860, 78.9, 'Orion', 'Rigel, also known by its Bayer designation Beta Orionis (β Ori, β Orionis), is the brightest star in the constellation Orion and the seventh brightest star in the night sky, with visual magnitude 0.13. The star as seen from Earth is actually a triple star system, with the primary star (Rigel A) a blue-white supergiant of absolute magnitude −7.84 and around 120,000 times as luminous as the Sun. A blue-white supergiant, it has exhausted its core hydrogen and swollen out to 79 times the Sun''s radius. An Alpha Cygni variable, it pulsates periodically. Visible in small telescopes and 500 times fainter than Rigel A, Rigel B is itself a spectroscopic binary system, consisting of two main sequence blue-white stars of spectral type B9V that are themselves estimated to be 2.5 and 1.9 times as massive as the Sun.\r\n\r\n<p>The apparent magnitude of Rigel is listed in the astronomical database SIMBAD at 0.13, making it on average the seventh brightest star in the celestial sphere excluding the Sun—just fainter than Capella. It is an irregular pulsating variable with a visual range of magnitude 0.05–0.18. Although Rigel has the Bayer designation "beta", it is almost always brighter than Alpha Orionis (Betelgeuse). Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Rigel is the third most inherently luminous first magnitude star after Deneb and Betelgeuse. Rigel has a color index (B–V) of −0.03, meaning it appears white or lightly blue-white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Culminating at midnight on 12 December, and at 9 pm on 24 January, Rigel is most visible in winter evenings in the northern hemisphere and summer in the southern. In the southern hemisphere, Rigel is the first bright star of Orion visible as the constellation rises. In stellar navigation, Rigel is one of the most important navigation stars, since it is bright, easily located and equatorial, which means it is visible all around the world''s oceans (the exception, areas within 8° of the North Pole).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spectroscopic estimates of Rigel''s distance place its distance between 700 and 900 light-years (210 and 280 parsecs). Hipparcos''s 2007 measurement of its parallax gives a distance of 860 light-years (260 parsecs), with a margin of error of about 9% (80 light-years). Moravveji and colleagues calculate a luminosity for Rigel based on this distance of 120,000 times that of the Sun. Its surface temperature is around 12,100 K. The interferometer-measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening, is 2.75±0.01 mas. At its estimated distance, this yields a physical size of about 79 times the radius of the Sun. Przybilla and colleagues used atmospheric modelling in 2006 to come up with a distance of 360 ± 40 parsecs (1,170 ± 130 light-years). They calculated it to be around 218,000 times as luminous as the Sun, and have around 21±3 solar masses and 109±12 times its radius. The CMFGEN code is an atmosphere code used to determine the properties of massive stars from analysing their spectrum and atmosphere. Analysis of Rigel using this method yields a luminosity 279,000 times that of the Sun, a radius 115 times that of the Sun and stellar wind velocity of 671,080 miles per hour.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HNcSI_b0C9_svPxHMl7cjSmtVPfrMfdVIKz11k0j-an0MYHgG8RrBMuNIizP9QMpmj3vEl4Y-a2ohNvYOOZqxRqmUaoM2mJAQ15E7qyOATI7jpVt-MilirWwQkJDY8Ojeu48XV8FYwReJMCgPrLCx5pSDObCI833tAYgO97vlTUTAyXcJWzP2dJ5iqTQHx7AE-7bSAhPEglNkPff9OKP8W-9ga0Kxmzdc1FqcIgwUAwVWJAMxliw_p1KMb42PAvdzFXkKJ-NscHlopRBQWOtlSnVcXaRgsfeXhXrJ9ucZGa-8moBdJ9FK-7qmw1fLVd-0PrMU7BW_-evkK0ijPgWiL-aeKf9vYVlPK8Z14-QbMwM1utMEjC0QupO65CZvjMf9MLPfCXuJFQ6PGg0iqbZWTDCpd5hDiuM5018UU-iL4AZu5W_O67kQizP7_XBLoPm9tbcPIU44yWTcWsS1AOo6JbWHOqYcYiZI_Zzid0JUl42BtxONqOZkQ4MkQoaA9ny47xR2yxjbiKJK_7jfIoFpJjRuMkqZqEAT8AcDaF9So4=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/56ht0Q3AhQ0XFTkAPqtWt6apDpYJMFf6Y1WdaGQaRgtmI_hvrXZB9GyVnXdZRHbiGOxyJBC2x8oI0skPnaEVYlwETP3X6ZQ005QPv37eerDYwswT88rcABrfsDcBTF1ZzVonBeZAPTPZRrxKJklyLKeg6bJ_lUQjErgMOfFynUjzRUM0BFFjQ294S7Takh0KYPLL1IWAcaVt7fH2KKFAy6Y47QFgdQNDUqaA_dyh9q_56L3WYvW6Xbp3rENrqVcgpYBQH98GxERgMzN5UgcodMUO4osX16MMwCPe_ze8EvqsD5wYN4qNLZxLSzsp_zm2R6axSES0fe_N6LwYBztiiNkLsSz_T5m2IfFcshA1yyp1gz_hZXneBqP_CzYxKn5uglKNm2hB3lXY0svBf8y85ZWwDx4Ra0q9pwzyz6p3zkdyV-KmeWKgciKedEFPlmumPPjHK5n-kiHyUbfyvfqy768vjHfpTTpPW9H96hevAnuhZhyTOTU1-MIqBxNMXJGFlRMFR-lIRw5OrQk2iVogVCqGusmqz4a1eonbmzwx13Y=w567-h600-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F8HTnao0IlB3Bb7CENaHvLuUTug0QrzlSLAjvmpGyuB6u0j9mjionJkJtU1tGW4cwUAWyA6a4RqVRtWzTmDHQSWk1AYK3T4TBiM3Hg3hZZfSv-vUhx4Kjt33TY58ePYZHhHLP7jeIjqUl3uQvpo4GhQi2QPLDQ69djLhzlYCogqNVcVegcnob07D2cc_qwhqnhOjw1CDSjWChaJX5muhlYfoBeyyP5Ks4epn4QfUtGc46AXbq6vUOKwf7u3WEvQ_yD3zq2nI8G5KZ2PIH_2MBQFTJ6WTvYb-zf45YBnZqL-ivQAwUw23HtfFZTbj3XItsfb3FjLWDdBVX3gekOro4VcM_zuxEOkuL21GuayrscdwfLpL_95Cb3xFxuInCH7BW7t5PEBDL_Rhq4zuk7YZcpuJHaynbDfh2OscYzy526MY1JYUj8RoypEiEBedgCsaHlhS-4q8wuMOz7A1HuaogCiUJnT42nxq9FZ3KYNZ7S2HSOcdmlSlujc1ehbUHgGcobYsKDHjAYaKH-iB1_NVinhPUIUUx_TPAlVGTUkrlWE=w522-h454-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Dxm6GM2TXHSsK_B3XjdAUZShZM-fiPLZAI2b53fRv1nnP_r85VviZWwBTCrPw9P4aP60PZY3HMGfuAHwDoOt9mAN2mW_c2f0q8FOZ6ZqwSE8t524dDeTp0xa8fl4-6wj_5qAFVkXFiAQ6dLosQmZmxPNRvirHd0eecT_wFLdjewP78kt-a_ZYJo8FCdEWVEDvTzRxkC8ysrke8eto_CH4zSZXw7wRtECJKktD3NFiZZYnCrGyqFyE9KYNPuJhtStGSdgOjea4Qoc01GVE0tDUKtxFcLsn6YCDuqqhMrh-KflPZ8wgCpihvK_KmDLlWdCvlNM59-VnOEo5iyOhQ78t8FQEjJhRXcmbpy18uORpBRIp8dLw-eKFZKrOYi35PmFYu5Q12iPyQWrNDC0au3eMTu2Y95OU7R7MKOkjpsmMp3gV-Q9z0dP7X-ItFS57GIDdG9tTqhp72Cg3U82TZqnuYeKd4X-rjp4PGN9LZHT0CS0uuk2xiuKryrIA9x65j2w9TN8CMOHqExtIm16VqPn4GZ9em7FT88JrZC-XZAiog0=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3F2P_zyNnV99a_kcXXTGoMv4dbL6l5LAvJTTNNtvys9mBJCIO2tb6oWpMLgiS3Acall2h6ssAffBBlP5ISYBvVufk5wlfpTiwCqUI2U3KiRSKRdI-hLWeOjoGscrcnrV6zkQ7wz_z7PS2gzqolHLYlUbBVUpwzYK5zgBbCKznlxc1JHqt8MT8JIlwMHXL1JD8afANM2UyPFiDzXzBohG4IDa9yER0GzktwqyqxMArokyDCsq_IphzAtfAnejYlTyQyzNMGIdqPM5ogKzhus6oe7N2Ku7GgbjhfKmOubQyPiT4en1bk2pLTZyAzMiwxgUJXUDnwmBx3xNnVJDk760rTaXpjseUfpQMIsnOxxLcCJ7KMJZtHbdFyExpTHcN-9BDmSNVfIIsZnhuWa8hiemUp8pxnaIAalJ-iY8Y-9jorwvlag7e_q01Vx6G8Whmi8nJ0HSOijtGfXrnXpHEVxrRGpQlodUzfy3h3hpvbCkAF-BJckZr3ym5gdIcuBLxE3aoIBuFQYc4fd324J3jn5-ak5bBC472_Lh7Uk42HW7Qbs=w278-h156-no'),
(5, 'Aldebaran', 65.3, 44.2, 'Taurus', 'Aldebaran /ælˈdɛbərən/ (α Tau, α Tauri, Alpha Tauri) is an orange giant star located about 65 light years away in the zodiac constellation of Taurus. With an average apparent magnitude of 0.87 it is the brightest star in the constellation and is one of the brightest stars in the nighttime sky. The name Aldebaran is Arabic (الدبران al-dabarān) and means "the Follower", presumably because it rises near and soon after the Pleiades.\r\n\r\n<p>In 1993 a substellar companion was reported. Subsequent observations did not confirm this claim, but a paper accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics in 2015 shows evidence for a planetary companion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The planetary exploration probe, Pioneer 10, which has been lost contact with, is currently heading in the general direction of the star and should make its closest approach in about two million years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March of 509 CE, a lunar occultation of Aldebaran was observed in Athens, Greece. English astronomer Edmund Halley studied the timing of this event, and in 1718 concluded that Aldebaran must have changed position since that time, moving several minutes of arc further to the north. This, as well as observations of the changing positions of stars Sirius and Arcturus, led to the discovery of proper motion. Based on present day observations, the position of Aldebaran has shifted 7′ in the last 2000 years; roughly a quarter the diameter of the full Moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>English astronomer William Herschel discovered a faint companion to Aldebaran in 1782; an 11th magnitude star at an angular separation of 117″. This star was shown to be itself a close double star by S. W. Burnham in 1888, and he discovered an additional 14th magnitude companion at an angular separation of 31″. Follow on measurements of proper motion showed that Herschel''s companion was diverging from Aldebaran, and hence they were not physically connected. However, the companion discovered by Burnham had almost exactly the same proper motion as Aldebaran, suggesting that the two formed a wide binary star system.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YtigqUx0YWfwysxJ7x86_43npkeCtm-B4qhUJaeMfrlDyVEKxGillIbuVoRxSv4sDcwbWJW9X5D6iDPbhjzZGR-Iekvl0II39oClZjwallI6ndo2X19eJg_IJ6kh2Y_syQUXUeuuuc_DogVwmQTkpCr3VVKef7gL0dSCn7YBicAGENYegxND5QULn3_RWqctI4gWkWTUg5IkNKTjsXqHIZ0JTRKdWMa-_tUy06oEv1Z3rQLLRUzYsm90Xv9kBqevn4_VHvt4UaIvi8LT6acTXAMwbN7_fziHJyV8siOxOFKpszzl1qmGEqIZf245fCP9GVDxnIY3JUJfn7QXh2ijna1pCrSduczkcrsHhJXfRmYF4Fv_830FYFSgONP-BOMB_GwvW8G04GH76imqx5y8WtQn9r3NW6pRM48srnukqB--R41JzM0mW1_whepU1hryclYNKAuwCDO5Dr-Ary6tpNXC4-1XnlP2piG9CShgKKq3WpoukhSKIcCi70N1mrP6TFKJbY9Fd89ZFCgXC631RpZ1UiwrJsGVL3mOqjOaGFA=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dIuPAFtJy2abp_XmvffWwxFdqd7opqs17tTBCPi23G_1JtPImEb2bodvHQQkIQlZXnI4Ckzj3H13IOXYggUim9rkqHuxeEXmkNN0Icse8CwR0BP5i70pMttbAWh5y1YaNfFDELCmsqjSfd01KF5Amtt-g6iQ2CMzqjROr0_oWRmJU42dIR1dtEgSY5Wv3yjY2VvZXCBzxKcwDpxMeeXveaOQzqTgDWMDzrK-O45smhxodUPI9rSyRiNVxJUqr2lNUzrTBhPKBxfh8w0LZGeqir-4gT4_rNIzYP0f7zHteO6uEKvXHyUDqxNw41Vn_ce3TnKwa2ficjk6EXbA2as09t9kLZBaIbfu1qwijbG_djbkBsI1Z0fOhlbZlVU2LvfqhWI5LEY0F4IQT_TltxOisoM7-caWIoow8LRgn62jS1ZxgAGy_sbNozFRqvAz7RLXf5Cjj3m3KX7eAr8q-wHQBQw7RquJlke9UBZOSKo_IwMCGc1V-wCD9Qq0uI-m_k9jfuX0FG2bmKvVvpkxFDKbymvCLnH8dx7-wJNUgVs16r8=w804-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5Samx1B2LjQXQa-LyHIE98287VYv8uxKNV6SagyGvtCPU-hlBGNO6Q8LSuoIFzDHDaN24z_oxGuEpL_5lzuYvd_FErgXtzpaZ8F4qf1CceDzSnlICpfv7JjzDP5vuKUPhpIVjtxakFk8FOdfjyzxRrbuldLmrz_RAZYAAvdmZx3vqB4S5FEWEgd50fsUfz7iNe3Ia7Z8UkB1bwoDr41s_lZKu2DQ3rUyxOFyoraWWxB6SIw3qmODvz0HjJBPnh4dzDjq1pJ1XyPra8mfuh31HrzolwadwN2NyZskMVzb9WPUYZDf0JSw5gdfChTc1DeVMSuoDYd_Ss4_pZfmZtAXIMyQiPzCrW-O4rL0knAJEOy0zr1-yow-G1ZOBy8SBcK9DwovV-22D7VEdnH-zzs379s-AJC-RNmYWB3C8gwrLgiUr_U0D_RkHm2Hj04y6zhrDx6LxOhIgTUYyd9mT3gsosYFOZ8g5M0RqM9vTXLMoq4tmmiQCW2F8hfGQuQyUBjf6hErYVQzSsbeCuw0SFJ74n19Y_psNIurbjPY4xomqgk=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GeI0sLWSuJ6xtdT2O9DWwPk7mm_QfPVkpV-9WcVPtsCy_wHfe6GRdF46v9x58NO-LBkTiax47r7lDcZToGuWILNC8zNvC-5_lYTibDYzjmvJHG_e714n0KoUrUz37T0upu4i4aLxZyUJNh9GlrcW2dpCOzPbzUYw0HOYoAZGSyRKTuhMJVlilEaVBDZb7cx0J--CWijGdFnQd54ANvOoQk-G0tB4PZ3uKeKsXqBAVh1DAsIG8GkAoGx4Xg7Oxr5HUZH0iAYAeKvHMbLaShaTTtKHwjHucA-gpzc8whAVE-X6JqXsAFCLxtnb8QuVfATnef_GXd9JPrlmOc0FxcfCBQvphkwxOpodzN6S_KUNisVGllG8z8tnqv6RK9mlX-jkFzgVVqOh_nJVD_x0Nz59eldaiR2rpa0FZydDW0XF5NpWJdV9z2kXpOfTmY7ia5VvjCp-VP0NDW81K8kkmiPrmTFJAdesDnecfBE9v873HKN3hHjAUdu5azjiYGNLh_M8RkMdbrhZSDEIIjs6_hMD6liAkdhdL3Nw0FBBNdPA2m0=w278-h156-no'),
(6, 'VY Canis Majoris', 3840, 1420, 'Canis Major', 'VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) is a red hypergiant star located in the constellation Canis Major. It is one of the largest stars (at one time it was thought to be the largest known) and also one of the most luminous of its type, and has a radius of approximately 1,420 ± 120 solar radii (equal to a diameter of 13.2 astronomical units, or about 1,976,640,000 km), and is located about 1.2 kiloparsecs (3,900 light-years) from Earth.\r\n\r\n<p>VY Canis Majoris is a single star categorized as a semiregular variable with an estimated period of 2,000 days. It has an average density of 5 to 10 mg/m<sup>3</sup>. If placed at the center of the Solar System, VY Canis Majoris''s surface would extend beyond the orbit of Jupiter, although there is still considerable variation in estimates of the radius</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first known recorded observation of VY Canis Majoris is in the star catalogue of Jérôme Lalande, on 7 March 1801, which lists it as a 7th magnitude star. Further 19th-century studies of its apparent magnitude demonstrate that the star has been fading since 1850. Since 1847, VY Canis Majoris has been described as a crimson star. During the 19th century, observers measured at least six discrete components, suggesting that it might be a multiple star. These discrete components are now known to be bright areas in the surrounding nebula. Visual observations in 1957 and high-resolution imaging in 1998 showed that there are no companion stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VY Canis Majoris is a high-luminosity M star with an effective temperature of about 3,500 K, placing it at the upper-right hand corner of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and meaning it is a highly evolved star. During its main sequence, it would have been an O-type star with a mass of 15 to 35 M<sub>☉</sun>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2006, University of Minnesota Professor Roberta M. Humphreys used the spectral energy distribution distance of VY Canis Majoris to calculate its luminosity. Since most of the radiation coming from the star is reprocessed by the dust in the surrounding cloud, she integrated the total fluxes over the entire nebula and showed that VY Canis Majoris has a luminosity of 5.6×10<sup>5</sup> L<sub>☉</sub></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recent estimates of the luminosity using a variety of methods give lower values of around 3×10<sup>5</sup> L<sub>☉</sub></p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U12U1ey4SAexHnYi8KTzcTRr0nOVDXKid4-KmORczX4Lk4bZzFoymeLDfgiks5Tz4SqJDtW_zAYMVCtf7S9v91ZBO2rgAEfxnlovJ4_k_iF-GS5eNQ-vMU1KwRqdVyFF3oCT1EsROJ4fKb7rd_e_QGcuNPEyMG0LMM05edlqq2eO1lMvSlZrHfvVp4oG55C2ej1asGaeBBh0JsXJFr3mJm9FByUpxDsAhp3CZexdE-KBYFyCBhRKAnzoSHeXtAjYKPK_wPkI0d3kYg_nIG3HC67iGKmZhzXzJN8lWSxwfHKS33ZSJajz_CS3mEeF7KCJ-CksTNBXfdB8YACSQy3e91QPXJfZ9tiZXt50_ETJedw1r20XUUr9ocafbSHIVZ2GIZ7rFOY03qTz617BdmU-YTAwHL5htJnslVJna8QAQooQBpL-xHKLL5jHC8DQdg4csj7fCvy9hmCGRDE2Si6XMekH_oWQPq9LxQKV84fDjq-CF2HRMrHrwNLUW3hEIgY3srUqtR1e0McHYm8GJwgGRbDvJ_6YA2b0aFrl_FU0Zms=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gkIu2DGzK9MOCzrKMdrG4uhoRuIH_F8H3D0GkIHSYNGiUlG0Tks6uO9ExLz5WtXNsfml4BsBcnqXKYA2psv19tr1uZzoSW9Gifeimn3YyL6Q8aYWNP55x4y5mheJkEAb-SZuDckjVAA8qI3_a7hlDftmrqv84Os6PRlAdWJ_T--BpuVhHXL0edgOPvKf68WpQR06TBv8zgTQYaw__bI_4Nv-WTOSWL2Uzo0hD6Y6y-3n1ZdVKSzvaHPeF1bxvMSLy_1sr0eX9svDAwfm91WHubNweNo7aHESeDOTJCIN9Zm-37MeZraU_aidIMBvgRNvImuDdkGUewsCJpjgnqnlWtSoRRvXJPlSZINc_pS_YWIAYya3WTVOWQD5Cb4Lt4m7yDqpx3XErPS1JzvKZ3RJNGwuVWS8sp_uESNXdJINRm-lzJzl9KT9y3MUIdtl70bUIcX1_U9Q3XrYnCE-IcRR-hYBya9mxpN58H53glJL5rLfrLtGEuVNfJUkA8XMVtKNdgan7zzQg-PCGI5YntL-48bPPW7XK-Tqo6aus8Ls0Ak=w827-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F-WDgADZMmf7xJ6xq8atELx3nG_eglNJfWJMDBS9dQzrYmUa4nEpE-rHQBxoZjscCQ0gbidIZJ8mGj2GDenZyEtfHHhBDntTcV6ppCaTut1po3lJA6AeRb1HV37Hxmbehb44ObxTtnRmDfOrhiJDp9-gCV4Fr4RDKdXXNxn-kHSLMb9MeOBrluC4JRABTMr1pbghewHvAyVM1EkjanKfutwoLkQQahWbFOPesEhohHoX5tQTs32YpHGm5kPAEsnEFIFfUNdYfdzGrC5icpvLwUtE32kesb6HHjNo8nY9yweba6UyQH6-9YpHhxoxFPYf-aBnuFsK-vl_ZQDjEFDz9uSGk2XWpfFZ3iGOqW4mKXPRYMPN00Od0fbU-GGXHGVSWPzdnhwZRWLiAjnwbIIetcwM5dSILvrmiJur1gFlwW-tUqMRrvDSF-QPCRmdAm_vkXy-FDrBT3ozR63-XAXOWtLkUPO9oSAPJOiuRdAuh_QeXjOI-4CS_qZpvYisBWn1cpFufLmx_La6x2TlLE5rAnauzNE5ZP5sv4z_1MuW1R0=w1280-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pofUM5zaavclGo1D3_Pe_mRqQoawBpipdvWcALQBUhqeyoTJSXmDZs6OscXgDjBEUEQD6sN6iGTUhSXpJcAXEni0HXCbpTuF-NxxQXMItiBRuKBUk-HIjk9L-dVQCNKXD57379uC3GdLKtcLczjsBISXqpEOU7yCXWq6IPgw28aM5pVExTpVka3jJSBPz0PE34wifb2u_SQMxNjk0itsfdQeOfP2gqEwSLYm0EQplnCgjecN2KwERdqQTkRPfbj4F9hofjZid8aZVJnEOfBD7C6nKGH91jRmXK01CzvpW2-_FDyRyAT3F380vf1rOc1z2p2Fl_-7Z9qBsLH8y6Z_v6P4NRNk7v1aB8RtlErQR3xE8oves3d9ls23Nqc88iJ5NlbVpDhQgUo0jsJ6yY-gJCoe-gSttXsbGuuqkdSKARz1XvVnZRNVS0QYVj__1Wo1FJ6yQ5dOsCVo1lmVpWioOmjZaOZ3WDmRg36TqzcebWtTmzs0INTs0QhwY_UWjdEtQgf_do6Q2iVf-vnc3i6nNt1ftmwT5kRx2Zihe3AenZo=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8_uqHGdwhgT5sgBwQcJrStuGSU6T8ElZ64XZzmQ_0KaOaPiRGawW-iLU8j-68bfMy4neKln24-A_8Q79CllSHOU3Yl4BVjaN6m-gjgAQ_ubTfJXZ-mBPeYrQ3F0x869iRukDLTHg0DdZahQzJAY9C5Dy5haKFv50Q0yN-UFVeqmmIPrtHXRPu6c9tJUl7_7h03kqXxH8gGr2yJRB_h9XT9KdyuFUxCEjdMfGBumdE8D78VLobSqcLGA4PvQsk131ic9CliTet5oJLvxMrn7QdzPzQLUH0bLunCjj46tHmkxU5KQ47K_JiYiDO7a-yuEphx1--ZIco3yINSrRE0BA1dgQzHt46dO55PcO7qY58yTvaDcOnRFe1uiamyElSH0fk1bA06di-74H1BzjjkaN7G_5tUJ0ias9_dqhziGSmABUXlbGxkzxayuJp1F3SyLS_-dv8seNg9COHcRTbacogexj12diM118WyW6KjrlWRFVi4Y9FjYgg6O9O-0BRjMoC8jdyIwNYSIO6LWN7XKkKkzl-gWoSkPivKFOtYvZ9aM=w278-h156-no'),
(7, 'Betelgeuse', 643, 950, 'Orion', 'Betelgeuse (/ˈbiːtəldʒuːz/, /ˈbɛtəldʒuːz/, /ˈbiːtəldʒɜrz/ or /ˈbiːtəldʒuːs/), also known by its Bayer designation Alpha Orionis (shortened to α Orionis or α Ori), is the ninth-brightest star in the night sky and second-brightest in the constellation of Orion. Distinctly reddish, it is a semiregular variable star whose apparent magnitude varies between 0.2 and 1.2, the widest range of any first-magnitude star. Betelgeuse is one of three stars that make up the Winter Triangle, and it marks the center of the Winter Hexagon. The star''s name is derived from the Arabic إبط الجوزاء Ibt al-Jauzā'', meaning "the hand of Orion". The Arabic letter for Y (which has two dots) was misread as B (with one dot) by medieval translators, creating the initial B in Betelgeuse.\r\n\r\n<p>The star is classified as a red supergiant of spectral type M2Iab and is one of the largest and most luminous observable stars. If Betelgeuse were at the center of the Solar System, its surface would extend past the asteroid belt, possibly to the orbit of Jupiter and beyond, wholly engulfing Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Estimates of its mass are poorly constrained, but range from 5 to 30 times that of the Sun. Its distance from Earth was estimated in 2008 at 640 light-years, yielding a mean absolute magnitude of about −6.02. Less than 10 million years old, Betelgeuse has evolved rapidly because of its high mass. Having been ejected from its birthplace in the Orion OB1 Association—which includes the stars in Orion''s Belt—this crimson runaway has been observed moving through the interstellar medium at a supersonic speed of 30 km/s, creating a bow shock over 4 light-years wide. Currently in a late stage of stellar evolution, the supergiant is expected to proceed through its life cycle before exploding as a type II supernova within the next million years. An observation by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2013 revealed that the star''s winds are crashing against the surrounding interstellar medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1920, Betelgeuse became the second star (after the Sun) to have the angular size of its photosphere measured. Since then, researchers have used telescopes with different technical parameters to measure the stellar giant, often with conflicting results. Studies since 1990 have produced an angular diameter (apparent size) ranging from 0.043 to 0.056 arcseconds, an incongruity largely caused by the star''s tendency to periodically change shape. Due to limb darkening, variability, and angular diameters that vary with wavelength, many of the star''s properties are not yet known with any certainty. Adding to these challenges, the surface of Betelgeuse is obscured by a complex, asymmetric envelope roughly 250 times the size of the star, caused by colossal mass loss.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/z0dogsMLXtaAI2H4jN9XuOn-TiZvA64WJ15CMZ9RlkFg8-B6Nm8r7IiHSG8VL4ETCQyfV8W2irRntibvRvihAmdJvCXrapHCczsPrY9EG_uTUaZQma987CRn1FTYbeenUlWX7XbnvDT0_HEDGn1PlQaCByiTc8dXwQCQSmwlvJtu_SxPF2MfFmd1zb2w5NFSO_PsqX5vPP9ZPXk97rTYmC6h90sv1jXaUKHIGDPNE6iumF0S-VWhbNWoMDgCn55GgiQRRxG364TutXp9CVnZEO1Uv4GfhI9chqc4qtbOeHd5dslScLZdhp0A_YxcCztraDX2AMByQRnAkqNGPuxMmVqxw2kFtY7_N8IP8RnJmgLepQ43Sk4hXNWSJcLxghQ6yBCCBQ64oPS1_QzJ_thnD8WYcNDyhmPzhsF0h1mMltOmtJQYmxuf-CYK_iclfsh15v1HJZrs3nfhaIY5gnAHL_FR0BKpCL-_rNjZVhBmXi23hgXnAlP8hwpalSIEaWuxXx1PbRLoi_vh1qOCFishTe7mAdUxv2Ovro10jTUW_6w=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DffXyCOxgozD8kjIee-cYqcKidGpdpyyj4nod4A4KYg89W9XsxjSJdXnHnqNDNJajlQDTFn_lww0Ww-SRkqs4gGqwASZPV7bSL9hUHHSvPmWCTYIXlHZOJfymawSMd0LGUOoc3ZQ_acWAgGheC8zvJcOE77-q2MMXEV-3s0hnoZ5ZypiVqjekyC9FA1EPUzjL-M99wz2tWGRL4mgnq2XBDVVBCZUcQ0xEpDeFlombmA58uY5QCIl38nVtAlCBhZZfxjoA56koCi8aQgiISCCRsqWqh-PK4ElKlkoTSzmxE9ff0CQmDcet5XDUX1fcsJSOWU0ktcGqTonJrde8A_rhiV-I3XocuD9-CquYrFKpKS2YGdW8OqBJIH4Zkbih7buhsQ7vSCaGvvk_CeHDuVerp65EBmOuAwYYgIpdxzcc9zK7WUyoaYBCFpSLOZCYdL8OPh4QgclMO8_oyT6XszSWjG02cPCk6NEaHGEkdQmma59TuHl53vygkCTnroD6yo5VEmmFF5rly9I8y9tSWuEk7PQtdA61JPtJsCjkeEJz-k=w400-h225-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IRDvgUU5Lm-MMSWesBC4ANVZsU9AqyaXRUBGLCKlLFEfZHY3x7sleT1PNqyUqIcylr3__uwYXJGUYeQyJigbcXDHDzDAKcpnXl_HxZ1iM8SfMyN3Oa7NeT9sn1Fdqm3gvfQAY2eB3PY-A1mL9svHjWd-VCgPLYKEsfk77xfbkfm6EBjZuDHWRJVGgJZ6mXzg9UmbnzqJqVN16XKCXk1qGDAx9oHe5RBxW7tBf6FyCpwDY0graCHFQGqO21ez0dKcG1rOHYBziTG_17g5WJF0pV2gPI42Qjtd_iqGbyBm9J1mz7-352rZT-FNVF4DXU99PIo5aZ8nqQyCZowreiSo-dijB_JTLNE_p3HZUMLo1DLgBDFNEVASSWncxUSmS2uR2hOHJ6skkczm-_5evQRaqFZuoyN4wPyZgttrZ4W4ms5nQeBBKMTKYIdzcRCR_PlL3mbDV0IlIL094CwyNclfknCE15TEL8MTjGE6xKqpcva8rI3JOJAB7F6FCfJm2vaqQLKCdEA43Zf2kNDXgtRqRKCfoXHuaewhRMRbra6SIGA=s640-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DffXyCOxgozD8kjIee-cYqcKidGpdpyyj4nod4A4KYg89W9XsxjSJdXnHnqNDNJajlQDTFn_lww0Ww-SRkqs4gGqwASZPV7bSL9hUHHSvPmWCTYIXlHZOJfymawSMd0LGUOoc3ZQ_acWAgGheC8zvJcOE77-q2MMXEV-3s0hnoZ5ZypiVqjekyC9FA1EPUzjL-M99wz2tWGRL4mgnq2XBDVVBCZUcQ0xEpDeFlombmA58uY5QCIl38nVtAlCBhZZfxjoA56koCi8aQgiISCCRsqWqh-PK4ElKlkoTSzmxE9ff0CQmDcet5XDUX1fcsJSOWU0ktcGqTonJrde8A_rhiV-I3XocuD9-CquYrFKpKS2YGdW8OqBJIH4Zkbih7buhsQ7vSCaGvvk_CeHDuVerp65EBmOuAwYYgIpdxzcc9zK7WUyoaYBCFpSLOZCYdL8OPh4QgclMO8_oyT6XszSWjG02cPCk6NEaHGEkdQmma59TuHl53vygkCTnroD6yo5VEmmFF5rly9I8y9tSWuEk7PQtdA61JPtJsCjkeEJz-k=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wx4RORmJzK4DAuER--_hhSs-E02wlPWP2DUed7aGh45uxcYAWFD2N9JLyAnUb4xwKdLLZe0SVmk3vUJQ2cf2S53mD2M19ReyuXEeowQ-fm-2hbLUob20GhxW6YOJDKYy3101FSegTb2RYuUN5sTEbA2RdEHIAYnaXFQr7Z7G4e4PQN0nZI-EqIxQIpA9yUWG2FD7lbyxWlm6nNTYseSL-WrUG56OI0HioC4wsfol0x6smLcFma1gifgsYoiqT14vsXcccLKc0i5cPq5NFG5qrwPgTwouBmIuOlbWegAjYhMbYuSgp9rDJxZ7rbgXbP9RCtGEc-DOuqZHlDbV9lOIDtjbX8XQDn7sQ6TZvfLhjqZKFf4UvtUehWJZo7CEf8hhUVDVGdAS3Tk1RocEGIPlF632AxAUdlruFVKK6CGhZiD7v0MvTRZc3BrP8QqSlKYHAbbKlOg3Tpq5izdSWD3BKnHeJlKCUJAmCifdpgEHf2fKqMFptWYPHtczTkhzIVkWbEIU1gDL6aapZi06g7zV1nDUghUH4cEHSxqetAXG1EM=w278-h156-no'),
(8, 'The Pistol Star', 25000, 306, 'Sagittarius', 'The Pistol Star is a blue hypergiant and is one of the most luminous known stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is one of many massive young stars in the Quintuplet cluster in the Galactic Center region. The star owes its name to the shape of the Pistol Nebula, which it illuminates. It is located approximately 25,000 light years from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius. It would be visible to the naked eye as a fourth magnitude star if it were not for the interstellar dust that completely hides it from view in visible light.\r\n\r\n<p>The Pistol Star was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in the early 1990s by Don Figer, Astronomer while at UCLA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The star is thought to have ejected almost 10 solar masses of material in giant outbursts perhaps 4,000 to 6,000 years ago (as observed from Earth). Its stellar wind is over 10 billion times stronger than the Sun''s. Its exact age and future are not known, but it is expected to end in a brilliant supernova or hypernova in 1 to 3 million years. The mass is equally uncertain, thought to have been over 100 times the Sun when initially formed but now considerably less due to extreme mass loss.

(9, 'Vega', 25.04, 2.78, 'Lyra', 'Vega (α Lyr, α Lyrae, Alpha Lyrae) is the brightest star in the constellation Lyra, the fifth brightest star in the night sky and the second brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus. It is a relatively close star at only 25 light-years from Earth, and, together with Arcturus and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun''s neighborhood.\r\n\r\n<p>Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed "arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun." Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BCE and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the declination will be +86°14''. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed and the first to have its spectrum recorded. It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale, and was one of the stars used to define the mean values for the UBV photometric system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium. Vega is also a suspected variable star that may vary slightly in magnitude in a periodic manner. It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274 km/s at the equator. This is causing the equator to bulge outward because of centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star''s photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is being observed from the direction of one of these poles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on an observed excess emission of infrared radiation, Vega appears to have a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars that display an infrared excess because of dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/H9xKnL_BCnRV6cEAEGxOs7CA0GcDi2RJyK2T3vc5pwwrDG80pOP5nIWjRZ0EXA-0zpP8Z-NObqGD0cW2ErUCfl7brbw0ANIK8ZXOiM_0Z6JNuxvqm4bPQUYh01wRsSnYD5MYWy-_rOnvqMKl_2it63J_XN5ZOoftv2uS0sdxXetGTJSIY0knyfZ1X-BSugBvH_HNo5o8EgD1R9tNyUCV_6k8rOuQBsDah-R1-_a0bwiPRDDapCEFE-D0S-TtLMHSpI6lmePUwWYOKNd660uf9U1fYzFL-Ozj-Ng-wgKX5oq4JBjdVoXS0ogV1ij0zamwSvJzp_8vbOgI2BPhdXBqy3hUAZacqJijChwOV9kMT7cvrHGuEeYaBvO3pG8MP9HTOhjqlHeSuZp9sdMp28LNbAQ4qdD-z4-AQBwoho3jqSQxVzyBHzaAnGHGNcChIUWUa1HqhPdC0dg3eJbNuszlGv8jhv1fPNhAkcV_LrQXIvUkmBBQJHZtZQq5EyIMNI-4kaYGqXuGxFif5nsrCpGnSv_DtwcG5fKt-dgqURaEumM=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Kl11POCizywXVEeaWR-Wktawly1pbjTeUK9g-q2TbWFTOIgc8M-R9oNbjq34g1oZXCHMPWrKPQuuBCLotl03o-_oiG-U3pGVxeYI5VLLrWQrjZ9un6U02DyU0dSEn615E7yHfv2s_ID62P8r4mnNK-uiMDReUJs2QV1llitZw7xRJpfxU7ODvpKQaTIbCZYuYaJfZ8LU3gDbP-JnbJ0FYJThEghthbcwjrx8wFw503XNTFwnGXmACo6dKyJnuJAaXFkezmWpHkdRlQanevZk47bTdcxfSXOrq7PF1zKz0gdpc39aufaxPN43OVo5F_8VP9ULjPjGvM-Z9vIvYM9OC7XBTP4LX1PVKE9QAs9AoPuJDT669qtBtSzsKVqJK0PNnN5S8TcS67i8NS__6JCkz18Yyr_iO_4PkZtoxoOTmpuJxAFE_LS8qFC7XvBBTL3yVwihwYw2F7EgevQWzbs65cyLCcXPNGRQvp7Ch83kVTyXqdJwTlKaIZimlcz7T43djmZw_9WFGBLmPuw0PF7lf7hXllA_jpeLLCOP5vQSMBE=s709-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RGy-UgJv0D4qxwlDGUn-OhjNtibKFpYxNtWOhDZx37aZbgYVX6UNucDV7wJvDCOuXoQQc6SVKjaZ6gGQISvK0pZVuQb-Tg_rO5vv_FVrOj2ytrxvyjDbz6sjg6cIXvcz8gNF2PD5wn9rk-SOwnJtB8-uU5weVg7apFB6qKygTnEdHbQ0q3YnBxErTLeVRjNV3e7x-lRHJhWabf7FIWt3csP_hpY6WIFNeT77R90cOGJnnFkXnCMMgtYjXEtNUFHw5R1LqXd4yjxutEHhuaVEC-VjwJ1okihF390T3A2HcD8isZw6YoqfOxRLJI2ebvnhENUjHM1q8hhYUzVURbdiE2xaSqGbTYj-Y-WzX6saSpK_KS1nnQBndZ5KJRzXPgBbYS5e5V6wqCTMbAjzRaCE994qjHs95llCjknnaJeqD8bIccIsNHvcaBfNK7MXOQA4SvU7b8jXh_qDPhdqNWagj4-wCsYkLKTSF5__E_TRLTxA_T2cz5Nm5EUnHcr8D51-k0z_XfFYrTIDbLjxewv1Hn5KxVHgu6oLylUDW_Pf79g=w690-h572-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rK7Obj3eyApt6sm6ydSXI9L9Z7EIbzxxRshcqy-hVT3q_C86bAb7QSJU-7_3OYt6uUJDIDOd2vIeL87H_T1NJzXJYhG3dUFbIaRJwhKdmCFU7wMygDMQFDkc-X90526Foswqo7_S7BNlND8jz7baEXSA775PJorMnJgJMa44TFLbCMfl0YI5TPKlXFqpCBZ0fXSI4r1suhL6T_af2B1lfcu4znq1INrcxJkwTD3RVeBJcIJRbubBaf9vOEpmDum1VjtQ62C_VJlDnnvzekmzbIupB5kx5QgcP-HDcCXGo47KSxfTOySAq-Xx288dcupZHFTpzrWkVAiBzTTCXRMXApGZRJ8hVst4V4KLy0RWmWo4lp722QDdgZYBvs3FxURU_0z0eD1Ue4SW6bMPK4FJGb7Fx_aWK4Mxr6qy0F8-pNWCzstVFM0FkHxBnRTmIAjwSLX3RR52FWV4BzY9KtV2eRn3YZoWSHIwXVGwzhh1OETAyE9yQRvkCGEFUaubKx-gLbwj-l5waw47XD526ydG1MQR3ZmoUdvVNBQuK0rlV1A=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y7ZX4bIlvfA2UeePBXWcw8sG8vjbp9e76EbCfiTK2706InZhqEt3vIfNGzPh5DbMs0-xI2zV17hz_EU47u8tzet4krgquojE86rljHI-2V7EfG1EhlhyNkiyIRgSnYrew6Kffr9fkrQdsTNcDxFtDpvXteSWWbqkslZQlpU8w8ErKDi8vr16apoKeOW9HDJ3CITNJJMtj-_cyMuxJAieKikt_O_i7n7PLLmBHekf4KmfXOWF7VshgCq_J6PdeooJybvpOXCyisygGSrAlVYXIbir-RZULT_caiNGLmqToO1zpfUQtn8ZayYOrDi8Svsr2FVAiJ7mhFJBwZkUioYWp9BqnuJynx1DPBSN9YOKgMERT1tB62Oa9KSBl2w_5T67t858BXw9_KJyK77d9_6IHbSZxglssBDa3DHISJdHXYHMPVHZGGb0F16qgNJD9HfVxag8zoVd66-nXdZr1h8wm8bdaYwr4EIFO2fSyl0YIV5i8Z61KxENHafkvimZephMFzFJxOhASHyQ4eH2XuKQu3S0jSg6Y5KOiJgn9MYFmeM=w278-h156-no');

With a visual magnitude of −0.04, it is the fourth brightest star in the night sky, after −1.46 magnitude Sirius, −0.86 magnitude Canopus, and −0.27 magnitude Alpha Centauri. It is a relatively close star at only 36.7 light-years from Earth, and, together with Vega and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun''s neighborhood.\r\n\r\n<p>Arcturus is a type K0 III orange giant star, with an absolute magnitude of −0.30. It has likely exhausted its hydrogen from its core and is currently in its active hydrogen shell burning phase. It will continue to expand before entering horizontal branch stage of its life cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one of the brightest stars in the sky, Arcturus has been significant to observers since antiquity. In Mesopotamia, it was linked to the god Enlil, and also known as Shudun, "yoke", or SHU-PA of unknown derivation in the Three Stars Each Babylonian star catalogues and later MUL.APIN around 1100 BC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ptolemy described Arcturus as subrufa "slightly red", and it has a B-V color index of +1.23, roughly midway between Pollux (B-V +1.00) and Aldebaran (B-V +1.54).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prehistoric Polynesian navigators knew Arcturus as Hōkūleʻa, the "Star of Joy". Arcturus is the zenith star of the Hawaiian Islands. Using Hōkūleʻa and other stars, the Polynesians launched their double-hulled canoes from Tahiti and the Marquesas Islands. Traveling east and north they eventually crossed the equator and reached the latitude at which Arcturus would appear directly overhead in the summer night sky. Knowing they had arrived at the exact latitude of the island chain, they sailed due west on the trade winds to landfall. If Hōkūleʻa could be kept directly overhead, they landed on the southeastern shores of the Big Island of Hawaiʻi. For a return trip to Tahiti the navigators could use Sirius, the zenith star of that island. Since 1976, the Polynesian Voyaging Society''s Hōkūle‘a has crossed the Pacific Ocean many times under navigators who have incorporated this wayfinding technique in their non-instrument navigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The French mathematician and astronomer Jean-Baptiste Morin observed Arcturus in the daytime with a telescope (a first for any star other than the Sun and supernovae) in 1635, and Arcturus has been seen at or just before sunset with the naked eye</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based upon an annual parallax shift of 88.83 milliarcseconds as measured by the Hipparcos satellite, Arcturus is 36.7 light-years (11.26 parsecs) from Earth—relatively close in astronomical terms. The margin of error is 0.54 milliarcseconds, translating to a margin of error of ±2.3 light-years (0.7 parsecs)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with Spica and Denebola (or Regulus, depending on the source), Arcturus is part of the Spring Triangle asterism, and by extension, also of the Great Diamond after factoring in Cor Caroli.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NhCx5BTgM6beFiSjwsfZyDoyuEObJLM-Vk9bYiXIlRpACVh5cDk7N--QowOoURpswC3EO_bhJ7yuUr08NkJ30XGmi3lpScufbTfnQxZlAbzzoWGls1HkIZjIKpNbntniY_zjgguhh32N9dulktSGFon7lBfN4YkJzemTtPrVdmEr6NsJSvUblQ6y29f_vODxbT8mTDuQktCCwWyvJUIZPL4Euu3A6xWB3jm0cTU292fkiSbFl1BahPfUOtAC7cHX8Gy9TAPmtXy3vq7v0YgPjrH6Tuh8ZfFRKgR5jWT4tmTj5oCZhBmDXln2QsUol0eGq7nicPDzFhqNHXfByfxvBqYCPvWtQDQgr4MvclWbDVrBLtZa0FpRm01goPdDeIavlaCq8oCauav2nOltcOQXgDx5qZvBXsAML8DN8DXev04HuAkStJUQUdQ1F2LoIms_jFH9XSQ_aqjvQ7g2TUG2EPBv7Pud74iUdOh-uD8RpGK63jk1kJ7b9mvqVAo_2rp4YTVc6On_sYtsfXavhl4-iRPdLk9sK0-bdFOE19hN4kM=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pDdmO3xr7KJnGSiKfbaCqcNLDLaofN4wrzRWzyyi4EzdYuxgEowsOFmWSXUzGEYW0Gab0XbgnakRUqAaenXTaZESSup33cuRqZB1gwsmYlivra-gXflAZZ40c5fOSZ1nbl9jbMV91MX7NfdODYFwNG2HyhGpZElLz2mlt5lw_RBxZXpMZSXjyGX9Jsx7q5fSFYxWMWsx6ZJnHDZGR_2rUHGuuQOUXRBBC4fSj2sJ5x4ylVlfiPqLmWXZ-NFYCoXquwWagXpNTxt3SXanVRrcngyv7qimrYa7MSRh08gpFtg2ludtMNdV9QW3rRJyLVMmIE78PinA4yRLjindum40w6E50m3Zvm2XE_QP_UjzYLzXjNTvTxBaKofH8ISpC2Y0nfy08cTe5T5T55NEejRaf0aHVKBEF_KC1OFQ3nEOHqsCd9nyZpJA1MW6CxuN8hOAmUcH2NnefwuK1bgX0b5nFC2NsuxwPuJjMqSoSrulZAiYxNzTEMU2ljXth2fiQoL55Te-AWFATfnSsD2pIrPmkSHm_2XXcr_iGXUCNW8e0VU=s799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3A77Djq4QcfpREHPBHIuEr_hy3XxLZ8WJai6qPMdM5caiKRke88YG_yIy0JcQ9B7IevvGypPAOZQV__MZzEHMTEc57WRtAIiaT0a3f1_dRpLhnByJAcuXqLozmIHt85Tejs6fVk17FLkoJBAyzgtWPL_8kG4WTdSwKQmJeOeXPEgNaYDUtbeEZaNQxGfMlZokxwr_xGOsEKCi94W_jHHfzjZC8YlCEx4rLCrJ41QE1ZK2GoT1_3bzXE6RPXAVV-pwSqXXZCF3LRzZuKVuqnmMBth30YPuVIet7iDGHD8Hwcl7W4llMR7w4z8_xcqlnn3iSU6jq3zeySmhagPpXG-fFEgTTSmhCHmdJrc734D8S32uy-dNepdKtSQK6wpKfK2DM9OSapCwLSaGHX0eYmyb1NwAKmN0fxnm56QfAYPfbDGAQaV7CUzbTBEHDXQ5oidDgew9MfPXQLtZy3bM7I3BD_urmWUc5-gB4V9nR95q8Qmgk2oyj69imagxo8l7_AwIJ-Kty8noZ9GNcVjLGJuDapLszjMDycJG6pmoHtDrro=w460-h578-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B9hfVzxALcWWMXe2NMevbvwFeeS8eyDS9rEi_kX9tPBY2I0K7aLMuWeeif-KF070W5nTRbt7YuDknbzbOsQHoW_q4TCkmUpVyKPFG6U1Mm0oxSHlzf9wU1bRJcniuxcpn-AwDemY_bL_NXO8SWvXnAQrdZcQFZlg8C1c8NXfdIiIMMedaigSjJTWa4x4xfTBSFL9ElED_cqR353d_5H_4PRkVh167OsvRTVuxmqSh7ruP5B6BGwCpHbQ6UoxcvQVncBlenhrzGU_1OoUKqU065egHsWv3tasyG_sA3hBMCiANHmABNa1WLFhbMnW2oQBOVcWmQPTMzByr-iogLkWNZGWQvcW7MMNjYJGghxPSo6CzpzPy9tlSDEsr0Vu6Y8ihJ1E-Sc-VX-lpCZk_hcLOb6GUR3gGvwZHQabInr3JhbJcHHXMMgdxIiX-J0LgCQpSVSdfbUN7cLPOC_UKcGEkfDfOd56_lIJxJ1rxkiqvQpXsUnYmdqnaDgOHA8wrjRE79IAnzgWVH29qo2CQTnYDRHYF3iZx8lqmZaQTNyFcg8=w432-h504-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qOYqXk21u6QvpNYztLyXe3NHt7o31FBlslOPfKpRp38FiiSxtrFQGNI2Jgwx62inbbqmZkJwWYbqlxoylkn1vM5U6mSAJE2Lww5O2um6s7VxtPsioR0u9iLh9iAPpXMUAARazP_SjsJB7rwaAxpcCv_EWfCS4MUsHRWavZlj19HDPzaWY4mqEDS8Oyt-vsFcz-gEOxhIJknM6D1ZlfENFyQQ_KzmDH6mqe9LL3oxy6-MsFnZ8-m6qU3CGnMfe0kTX6S7iXXKHOk0wHwORZmG6AqP1i8iAOsUa2RMsUcb4grFrieGK702sK19kI8L67-Lm4knzh6yUZgL2a-tcRiTbFrtTwk_ACdfiHtKsYC2LSSj1P1SEZujA1g7jxbAh5FYxeWrzoU1hiLkKMqx8nFd6CBY-WkbdH_XuBUdmQLRU-kczXyoLnrQVM96_eThbQgEWgC2nEpaCwbDvugi7ien8QQ_e0B2HxUlgj-ryVxClc40a5IH0xevwVTtEhB7JsM4_Oe96lQbnXCKoVmkqR1UwtZA4f1c1X_SofYfEUTKK8Y=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dtKaN6zYnp5blng1fqXEfWj8buNJXt96RygnVwD5AFbHxlskVog7T9qKH6zGH49UUM9rqfIdE8kt-PI4gwJbzvVFeq-rgpm2Ar12ycPmcm-x1xddW-I_e-djVkslkyLDzOeEPzCUep7WNk7e5bw8KxnZKvwREghDV2uC6xDlB1aNDHT2hJdAXCGwFE91w0R--poBHEAzwqLV6rPos30T5RrQQH8QnOBHqErwbqsC5YmyJtzwV737tWxA081OSQQTFmRovnNoxMKaZLp06CzJ1uTGRzRhyvT4VunyeH3Co28_0iHd7AUrwG5FBcAZo89jbzzGgmbq3XQCzmDcp09-z5REyoOVJsBHUpzBvoi1KUWiVf5Vm46A8rYaL1jp5WxtESpU2izd88llxbCWlqgh94HDyAJcDKKaLUfV7rq11KOy_0DTIOIgZ3f7iLXQy9aqL79KIZnLM12n2kEhfrAsApFU8pms0ySg4wlw4P8v69x2ehX4h0H2xSgoFWtJXJNvk5UkZ1Yr-2hhEEQr0TvA6X0EeQ2A-Khvqf2iIVykuKY=w278-h156-no'),

It consists of three stars, the pair Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B and a small and faint red dwarf, Alpha Centauri C—better known as Proxima Centauri—that is probably (but not certainly) gravitationally bound to the other two. To the unaided eye, the two main components appear as a single object of an apparent visual magnitude of −0.27, forming the brightest star in the southern constellation Centaurus and the third-brightest star in the night sky, only outshone by Sirius and Canopus.\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha Centauri A (α Cen A) has 110% of the mass and 151.9% the luminosity of the Sun, and Alpha Centauri B (α Cen B) is smaller and cooler, at 90.7% of the Sun''s mass and 44.5% of its luminosity. During the pair''s 79.91-year orbit about a common center, the distance between them varies from about that between Pluto and the Sun to that between Saturn and the Sun. Proxima is at the slightly smaller distance of 1.29 parsecs or 4.24 light years from the Sun, making it the closest star to the Sun, even though it is not visible to the naked eye. The separation of Proxima from Alpha Centauri AB is about 0.06 parsecs, 0.2 light years or 15,000 astronomical units (AU), equivalent to 500 times the size of Neptune''s orbit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Alpha Centauri system has been reported to contain one planet, the Earth-sized Alpha Centauri Bb, which would be the closest known exoplanet to Earth, but its existence has been questioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha Centauri is the name given to what appears as a single star to the naked eye and the brightest star in the southern constellation of Centaurus. At −0.27 apparent visual magnitude (calculated from A and B magnitudes), it is fainter only than Sirius and Canopus. The next-brightest star in the night sky is Arcturus. Alpha Centauri is a multiple-star system, with its two main stars being Alpha Centauri A (α Cen A) and Alpha Centauri B (α Cen B), usually defined to identify them as the different components of the binary α Cen AB. A third companion—Proxima Centauri (or Proxima or α Cen C)—has a distance much greater than the observed separation between stars A and B and is probably gravitationally associated with the AB system. As viewed from Earth, it is located at an angular separation of 2.2° from the two main stars. If it were bright enough to be seen without a telescope, Proxima Centauri would appear to the naked eye as a star separate from α Cen AB. Alpha Centauri AB and Proxima Centauri form a visual double star. Direct evidence that Proxima Centauri has an elliptical orbit typical of binary stars has yet to be found. Together all three components make a triple star system, referred to by double-star observers as the triple star (or multiple star), α Cen AB-C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha Centauri A is the principal member, or primary, of the binary system, being slightly larger and more luminous than the Sun. It is a solar-like main-sequence star with a similar yellowish color, whose stellar classification is spectral type G2 V. From the determined mutual orbital parameters, Alpha Centauri A is about 10% more massive than the Sun, with a radius about 23% larger. The projected rotational velocity ( v·sin i ) of this star is 2.7 ± 0.7 km·s,<sup>−1</sup>, resulting in an estimated rotational period of 22 days, which gives it a slightly faster rotational period than the Sun''s 25 days. When considered among the individual brightest stars in the sky (excluding the Sun), Alpha Centauri A is the fourth brightest at an apparent visual magnitude of +0.01, being fractionally fainter than Arcturus at an apparent visual magnitude of −0.04.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha Centauri B is the companion star, or secondary, of the binary system, and is slightly smaller and less luminous than the Sun. It is a main-sequence star of spectral type K1 V, making it more an orange color than the primary star. Alpha Centauri B is about 90% the mass of the Sun and 14% smaller in radius. The projected rotational velocity ( v·sin i ) is 1.1 ± 0.8 km·s<sup>−1</sup>, resulting in an estimated rotational period of 41 days. (An earlier, 1995 estimate gave a similar rotation period of 36.8 days.) Although it has a lower luminosity than component A, star B emits more energy in the X-ray band. The light curve of B varies on a short time scale and there has been at least one observed flare. Alpha Centauri B at an apparent visual magnitude of 1.33 would be twenty-first in brightness if it could be seen independently of Alpha Centauri A.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alpha Centauri C, also known as Proxima Centauri, is of spectral class M6 Ve, a small main-sequence star (Type V) with emission lines. Its B−V color index is +1.82 and its mass is about 0.123 solar masses (M<sub>☉</sub>), or 129 Jupiter masses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, the bright visible components of the binary star system are called Alpha Centauri AB (α Cen AB). This "AB" designation denotes the apparent gravitational centre of the main binary system relative to other companion star(s) in any multiple star system. "AB-C" refers to the orbit of Proxima around the central binary, being the distance between the centre of gravity and the outlying companion. Some older references use the confusing and now discontinued designation of A×B. Because the distance between the Sun and Alpha Centauri AB does not differ significantly from either star, gravitationally this binary system is considered as if it were one object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asteroseismic studies, chromospheric activity, and stellar rotation (gyrochronology), are all consistent with the α Cen system being similar in age to, or slightly older than, the Sun, with typical ages quoted between 4.5 and 7 billion years (Gyr). Asteroseismic analyses that incorporate the tight observational constraints on the stellar parameters for α Cen A and/or B have yielded age estimates of 4.85 ± 0.5 Gyr, 5.0 ± 0.5 Gyr, 5.2–7.1 Gyr, 6.4 Gyr, and 6.52 ± 0.3 Gyr. Age estimates for stars A and B based on chromospheric activity (Calcium H & K emission) yield 4.4–6.5 Gyr, whereas gyrochronology yields 5.0 ± 0.3 Gyr.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MIljHv4DofIwukT50iXmEpf4E0zYlXCztldeaegkUzanX02sEveLWEzoWH3BBC9jgAa72O8FAhERnFokH5N5BmLI5l6HPj9RcMK3R7RR16Ft5AmS5GwsIyT6KZgrjyA3quWIO__USmmRGQBQtacCbuYk161XRTMNyA1aaSWuQCwDWdNy1BOK_mYg2JhCzKgbbsCHq7rqjAP6av7EUG1mTT41k-Ka9jDSBlr71DHPDVBMquuwwYjQnnyTqvyUhyYvwo513rfiSJ94okDKlJ8GYAIvIablTxPkO_LRKLIgMNy3ppXvYLEuOTvaGDAkHlmuP9Wn1O3fII2eAXHiTRqx-j70Fm9NTtIBZW47V4Q6vcrGN3m_H44MBpNvHms1DnJztra4FvW1V9Guv3HGyUUSLDfCRn57-OPpKnc0U6evWjdCvu02mv1qxXDyJ0SYMwSvFz-_TGlCR1Zz7l6xHYgD3ICBVfaz2im05G1X8V567os6rbCcHnyaypfiyg_zGXecRZK0zzNfB0ytDQ_XWO0uytObzekiAGgM3V32_fBSKZQ=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qOYqXk21u6QvpNYztLyXe3NHt7o31FBlslOPfKpRp38FiiSxtrFQGNI2Jgwx62inbbqmZkJwWYbqlxoylkn1vM5U6mSAJE2Lww5O2um6s7VxtPsioR0u9iLh9iAPpXMUAARazP_SjsJB7rwaAxpcCv_EWfCS4MUsHRWavZlj19HDPzaWY4mqEDS8Oyt-vsFcz-gEOxhIJknM6D1ZlfENFyQQ_KzmDH6mqe9LL3oxy6-MsFnZ8-m6qU3CGnMfe0kTX6S7iXXKHOk0wHwORZmG6AqP1i8iAOsUa2RMsUcb4grFrieGK702sK19kI8L67-Lm4knzh6yUZgL2a-tcRiTbFrtTwk_ACdfiHtKsYC2LSSj1P1SEZujA1g7jxbAh5FYxeWrzoU1hiLkKMqx8nFd6CBY-WkbdH_XuBUdmQLRU-kczXyoLnrQVM96_eThbQgEWgC2nEpaCwbDvugi7ien8QQ_e0B2HxUlgj-ryVxClc40a5IH0xevwVTtEhB7JsM4_Oe96lQbnXCKoVmkqR1UwtZA4f1c1X_SofYfEUTKK8Y=w400-h225-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/An9AV3FRZrDyGvAXcYc3hV2rMNCPOzT6pu-PbONKBB9SqBD9ekse7zilm6f03okYWsQXC2kQryQ-yBysYmOmkBg2IAsHuDowsNH4Gd4Yaf_3Mvs09qz13sPnlgF9bL7s66_s77G7sDfH8VOJbRWPGhJHbaqW4awOo_W0XLV31oplK3_iUbGjwO37np8fh-MfIML0WiuG6p9F__yKz8DGu49dFLiggSrqfGN4_iEIFh1RVuoulVuA2F22YPKo__SxGrxEcQJ77RxaB2pomxcksOTGAFhkpFAksOaXnH5v6x27hTXebs6kFFKa5vB_GTmHFqFGb6UvPCiT43gQqFR8rk2im48-vJSDFPFwwI6hOv5Xqg0w-PauAu7CW8a4oXsawBizabc2aCXWojJH2QB-1AAIFwCRSV--DgOQHyNOKIrgVjgZl6QVMpKgBUW3whuQI5Pd5_HctKtWc5B9bBq9qY1EwvbuE-WVDk5pE2thAfQf42JE60kR-xQzz6GHKkBiVzHZdrzlKrckkK6Gj7JbsnwD36VnGzoEt1t8etI0Jug=s799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qOYqXk21u6QvpNYztLyXe3NHt7o31FBlslOPfKpRp38FiiSxtrFQGNI2Jgwx62inbbqmZkJwWYbqlxoylkn1vM5U6mSAJE2Lww5O2um6s7VxtPsioR0u9iLh9iAPpXMUAARazP_SjsJB7rwaAxpcCv_EWfCS4MUsHRWavZlj19HDPzaWY4mqEDS8Oyt-vsFcz-gEOxhIJknM6D1ZlfENFyQQ_KzmDH6mqe9LL3oxy6-MsFnZ8-m6qU3CGnMfe0kTX6S7iXXKHOk0wHwORZmG6AqP1i8iAOsUa2RMsUcb4grFrieGK702sK19kI8L67-Lm4knzh6yUZgL2a-tcRiTbFrtTwk_ACdfiHtKsYC2LSSj1P1SEZujA1g7jxbAh5FYxeWrzoU1hiLkKMqx8nFd6CBY-WkbdH_XuBUdmQLRU-kczXyoLnrQVM96_eThbQgEWgC2nEpaCwbDvugi7ien8QQ_e0B2HxUlgj-ryVxClc40a5IH0xevwVTtEhB7JsM4_Oe96lQbnXCKoVmkqR1UwtZA4f1c1X_SofYfEUTKK8Y=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nLB43XeP4RWpSys7J87ob7b78iezgudzaPghqtnR7_sVzCwR0DnkWwxuNLXUD7665YnCORMaB-L8CzVjgRoHTkxOkV2d8CV4UQcxLnCXDmhGAEkCLulM6OZ_jFV5oPwLrRFncW1lz7qTMFXuicxupNX3z6QgGNB2GPI62vLM1g7SMJWTPiewWs287wYiWOYnzRvU0-C4Dmk-meU0cLsMegxWGTkVzoGkOiyI43MABnf7ixphP_MZTp5Lz8DaZmh2A40wkKBNk-3Ih0M6yEulRGLIGRtkuvF8gaJz_eUG2935IMObw6Ia6dY8WODZunPZZjYVSPI_9oCJKQ7uuwu7DY-0Fz4WHz5FySVvCng12_troiX7VKIpK_gz7DuujXq1Q31MX9yHm1AYlBt9g342DhFZCb8hzJdwUzq-QeeMBjLAZHnmSP_4mOR9Gfyx-111qMcsKTKdN5iBus0IkD2W8LfIQBrhXVVjIyrmvZ914Ai5sqLyCgJ_R2Pkh_CAZitHFoRXaHZKFCPwwA1Nc5i8Mg_LnbZ9x1b9fcDHRWSi_60=w278-h156-no'),
(12, 'Fomalhaut', 25.13, 1.842, 'Piscis Austrinus (Fomalhaut A+B), Aquarius (Fomalhaut C)', 'Fomalhaut (Alpha Piscis Austrini, Alpha PsA, α Piscis Austrini, α PsA) is the brightest star in the constellation Piscis Austrinus and one of the brightest stars in the sky. It is a class A star on the main sequence approximately 25 light-years (7.7 pc) from Earth as measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. It is classified as a Vega-like star that emits excess infrared radiation, indicating it is surrounded by a circumstellar disk. Fomalhaut, K-type star TW Piscis Austrini and M-type star LP 876-10 constitute a triple system even though the companions are separated by several degrees.\r\n\r\n<p>Fomalhaut holds a special significance in extrasolar planet research, as it is the center of the first stellar system with an extrasolar planet candidate (Fomalhaut b) imaged at visible wavelengths. The image was published in Science in November 2008. Fomalhaut is the third brightest star known to have a planetary system (as viewed from Earth), after Pollux and the Sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a declination of −29.6°, Fomalhaut is located south of the celestial equator, and hence is best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere. However, its southerly declination is not as great as that of stars such as Acrux, Alpha Centauri and Canopus, meaning that, unlike them, Fomalhaut is visible from a large part of the Northern Hemisphere as well. Its declination is greater than that of Sirius and similar to that of Antares. At 40°N, Fomalhaut rises above the horizon for eight hours and reaches only 20° above the horizon, while Capella which rises at approximately the same time will stay above the horizon for twenty hours. From England the star never appears much brighter than magnitude 2.2 due to it being so close to the horizon, and from southern Alaska or Scandinavia it never rises above the horizon at all. Fomalhaut can be located in these northern latitudes by the fact that the western (right-hand) side of the Square of Pegasus points to it. Continue the line from Beta to Alpha Pegasi towards the southern horizon: Fomalhaut is about 45˚ south of Alpha Pegasi, with no bright stars in between.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fomalhaut is a young star, for many years thought to be only 100 to 300 million years old, with a potential lifespan of a billion years. A 2012 study gave a slightly higher age of 440±40 million years. The surface temperature of the star is around 8,590 K (8,320 °C). Fomalhaut''s mass is about 1.92 times that of the Sun, its luminosity is about 16.6 times greater, and its diameter is roughly 1.84 times as large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fomalhaut is slightly metal-deficient as compared to the Sun, which means it is composed of a smaller percentage of elements other than hydrogen and helium. The metallicity is typically determined by measuring the abundance of iron in the photosphere relative to the abundance of hydrogen. A 1997 spectroscopic study measured a value equal to 93% of the Sun''s abundance of iron.[nb 1] A second 1997 study deduced a value of 78% by assuming Fomalhaut has the same metallicity as the neighboring star TW Piscis Austrini, which has since been argued to be a physical companion. In 2004, a stellar evolutionary model of Fomalhaut yielded a metallicity of 79%. Finally, in 2008, a spectroscopic measurement gave a significantly lower value of 46%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fomalhaut has been claimed to be one of approximately 16 stars belonging to the Castor Moving Group. This is an association of stars that share a common motion through space and have been claimed to be physically associated. Other members of this group include Castor and Vega. The moving group has an estimated age of 200±100 million years and originated from the same location. Unfortunately more recent work that has found that purported members of the Castor Moving Group appear to not only have a wide range of ages, but their velocities are too different to have been possibly associated with one another in the distant past. Hence, "membership" to this dynamical group has no bearing on the age of the Fomalhaut system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fomalhaut is surrounded by several debris disks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inner disk is a high-carbon small-grain (10-300 nm) ash disk clustering at 0.1 AU from the star. Next is a disk of larger particles with inner edge 0.4-1 AU of the star. The innermost disk is unexplained as yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outermost disk is at a radial distance of 133 AU (1.99×10<sup>10</sup> km; 1.24×10<sup>10</sup> mi), in a toroidal shape with a very sharp inner edge, all inclined 24 degrees from edge-on. The dust is distributed in a belt about 25 AU wide. The geometric center of the disk is offset by about 15 AU (2.2×10<sup>9</sup> km; 1.4×10<sup>9</sup> mi) from Fomalhaut. The disk is sometimes referred to as "Fomalhaut''s Kuiper belt". Fomalhaut''s dusty disk is believed to be protoplanetary, and emits considerable infrared radiation. Measurements of Fomalhaut''s rotation indicate that the disk is located in the star''s equatorial plane, as expected from theories of star and planet formation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On November 13, 2008, astronomers announced an object, which they assumed to be an extrasolar planet, orbiting just inside the outer debris ring. This was the first extrasolar orbiting object to be seen with visible light, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. A planet''s existence had been previously suspected from the sharp, elliptical inner edge of that disk. The mass of the planet, Fomalhaut b, was estimated to be no more than three times the mass of Jupiter but at least the mass of Neptune. There are indications that the orbit is not apsidally aligned with the dust disk, which may indicate that additional planets may be responsible for the dust disk''s structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However M-band images taken from the MMT Observatory put strong limits on the existence of gas giants within 40 AU of the star and Spitzer Space Telescope imaging suggested that the object Fomalhaut b was more likely to be a dust cloud. In 2012, two independent studies confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist; but it is shrouded by debris, so it may be a gravitationally-bound accumulation of rubble rather than a whole planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herschel Space Observatory images of Fomalhaut reveal a large amount of fluffy micrometer-sized dust is present in the outer dust belt. Because such dust is expected to be blown out of the system by stellar radiation pressure on short timescales, its presence indicates a constant replenishment by collisions of planetesimals.

(13, 'Canopus', 310, 71.4, 'Carina', '<p>Canopus (/kəˈnoʊpəs/; α Car, α Carinae, Alpha Carinae) is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Carina, and the second brightest star in the night-time sky, after Sirius. Canopus''s visual magnitude is −0.72, and it has an absolute magnitude of −5.65.</p>\r\n<p>Canopus is a supergiant of spectral type F. Canopus is essentially white when seen with the naked eye (although F-type stars are sometimes listed as "yellowish-white"). It is located in the far southern sky, at a declination of −52° 42'' (2000) and a right ascension of 06h24.0m.</p>\r\n<p>Its name comes from the mythological Canopus, who was a navigator for Menelaus, king of Sparta.</p>\r\n<p>In Indian Vedic literature, the star Canopus is associated with the sage Agastya, one of the ancient rishis (the others are associated with the stars of the Big Dipper). Agastya, the star, is said to be the ''cleanser of waters'' and its rising coincides with the calming of the waters of the Indian Ocean. It is considered the son of Pulasthya, son of Brahma.</p>\r\n<p>Canopus was not visible to the ancient Greeks and Romans; it was, however, visible to the ancient Egyptians, as well as the Navajo, who named it Ma’ii Bizò‘. \r\n<p>The Bedouin people of the Negev and Sinai also knew it as Suhayl, and used it and Polaris as the two principal stars for navigation at night. Due to the fact that it disappears below the horizon, it became associated with a changeable nature, as opposed to always-visible Polaris, which was circumpolar and hence ''steadfast''. It is also referred to by its Arabic name: سهيل (Suhayl, Soheil in Persian), given by Islamic scientists in the 7th century AD.</p>\r\nCalled the Star of the Old Man (in Chinese: 老人星; pinyin: Lǎorénxīng) in Chinese, Canopus appears (albeit misplaced northwards) on the medieval Chinese manuscript the Dunhuang star chart, despite not being visible from China. The Chinese astronomer Yi Xing had journeyed south to chart Canopus and other far southern stars in 724 AD, though they were likely known to the Chinese from earlier times.</p>\r\n<p>Bright stars were important to the ancient Polynesians for navigation between the many islands and atolls of the Pacific Ocean. Low on the horizon, they acted as stellar compasses to assist mariners in charting courses to particular destinations. Canopus served as the southern wingtip of a "Great Bird" constellation called Manu, with Sirius as the body and Procyon the northern wingtip, which divided the Polynesian night sky into two hemispheres. The Hawaiian people called Canopus Ke Alii-o-kona-i-ka-lewa, "The chief of the southern expanse"; it was one of the stars used by Hawaii-loa and Ki when they traveled to the Southern Ocean.</p>\r\n<p>The Māori people of New Zealand/Aotearoa had several different names for Canopus. Ariki ("High-born"), was known as a solitary star that appeared in the east, prompting people to weep and chant. They also named it Atutahi, Aotahi or Atuatahi, "Stand Alone". Its solitary nature indicates it is a tapu star, as tapu people are often solitary. Its appearance at the beginning of the Maruaroa season foretells the coming winter; light rays to the south indicate a cold wet winter, and to the north foretell a mild winter. Food was offered to the star on its appearance. This name has several different mythologies attached to it as well. One story tells of how Atutahi was left outside of the basket representing the Milky Way when Tāne wove it. Another related myth surrounding the star says that Atutahi was the first-born child of Rangi, who refused to enter the Milky Way and so turned it sideways and rose before it. The same name is used for other stars and constellations throughout Polynesia. Kapae-poto, "Short horizon", referred to the fact that it rarely sets from the vantage point of New Zealand; Kauanga ("Solitary") was the name for Canopus only when it was the last star visible before sunrise.</p>\r\n<p>The Tswana people of Botswana knew Canopus as Naka. Appearing late in winter skies, it heralded increasing winds and a time when trees lose their leaves. Stock owners knew it was time to their sheep with rams. To the ǀXam-speaking Bushmen of South Africa, Canopus and Sirius signalled the appearance of termites and flying ants. They also believed stars had the power to cause death and misfortune, and they would pray to Sirius and Canopus in particular to impart good fortune or skill.</p>\r\n<p>The Kalapalo people of Mato Grosso state in Brazil saw Canopus and Procyon as Kofongo "Duck", with Castor and Pollux representing his hands. The asterism''s appearance signified the coming of the rainy season and increase in manioc, a food staple fed to guests at feasts.</p>\r\n<p>Canopus traditionally marked the rudder of the ship Argo Navis. English explorer Robert Hues brought it to the attention of European observers in his 1592 work Tractatus de Globis, along with Achernar and Alpha Centauri, noting "Now, therefore, there are but three Stars of the first magnitude that I could perceive in all those parts which are never seene here in England. The first of these is that bright Star in the sterne of Argo which they call Canobus. The second is in the end of Eridanus. The third is in the right foote of the Centaure."</p>\r\n<p>In the southern hemisphere, Canopus and Sirius are both visible high in the sky simultaneously, and reach the meridian just 21 minutes apart. Brighter than first magnitude, Canopus can be seen by naked eye already in the early twilight. Most visible in the southern hemisphere summer, Canopus culminates at midnight on December 27, and at 9PM on February 11.</p>\r\n<p>It is a circumpolar star when seen from points that have latitude south of 37°18'' S; for example, Victoria and Tasmania, Australia; Auckland and south of it, New Zealand; Bahía Blanca, Argentina; and Valdivia, Chile and south of these cities in South America. Since Canopus is so far south in the sky, it never rises in mid- or far-northern latitudes; in theory the northern limit of visibility is latitude 37°18'' north. This is just south of Athens, Richmond (USA), and San Francisco, and very close to Seville and Agrigento. It is almost exactly the latitude of Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, California, from which it is readily visible because of the effects of elevation and atmospheric refraction, which add another degree to its apparent altitude. Under ideal conditions it has been spotted as far north as latitude 37°31'' from the Pacific coast. Another northernmost record of visibility came from Mount Nemrut in Turkey, latitude 37°59''. It is more easily visible in places such as the Gulf Coast and Florida, and is best viewed around 9 p.m. on February 6.</p>\r\n<p>F-type supergiants have been described as yellow-white or white. Canopus has a B-V color index of 0.16 where 0 is a blue-white, indicating it is essentially white, although has been described as yellow-white. Its spectral type has been recorded as either F0 or sometimes A9. It has less yellow than Altair or Procyon, whose color indexes have been measured at 0.22 and 0.42 respectively. It may be that some observers have perceived it as yellow-tinged owing to its being located low in the sky and hence subject to atmospheric effects.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u3Cqayt-rgyJcS4Kc-lHycgP-ByUSynROfqfVfeAMW2Qdi0zPSKhS0AjK_YShjdpnRXO_4USeUJfwBV3BAlCihhh7MkiEHU3pKGf0INQptZT0IRSm3siJ6QBbNpz_k5gWmCwz6AJ-iqatYZtyUmqKBhHEYvzY3QbFfKQOUEX7k7CooFjRYWsXQSoeAARsY3QJbyY_sNpa5HYpYDFwv-OIIFV_ykZKDhpA18z-ZNitB3bAkqXyeY4xORgZRglc8rGQNivzsZq7cbzZbepEWvyrzASSYvbvpcTUfu8a26s_BXPLwkyz9H1GHcOnO4QqVIVOVtgvLuOaQySUB0E299CWrgW4ifDieMVMX0NHF7BwD6n_9N9XTEExyO_SgQ_425IsA8MgLCJW2yBwaUnhXCFOmU9G07nhW2haOtJpA-W2Pxrm17A56QCLIj22g5cLdO1y9xEEtor7iNLfULJSE7eNDE0aslErgxdMwRIIUDknkG4GltXOuDRKWuZE27Bt7PLH26z7UWhbk-umlM-e93z_vQAei9y4M_2ughE8MR_III=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PQ_8Tv4eFZV5CPTx3vz-c6AmC2E3HFfn0MamMV0G9QaXYnUrCZHVIx3eH1t-cJO-kgh4uL0mqkXIxX0sSvWqTK8RLgMObmk6JbVVWoVptHB9dphJLA3DP76i5lAKdaeFYDLlDkRN22k-5FdiuCO4hL7e6QLR2F8zLzx6ah6hYBzQ_Ebvm6yKxtOt-sqqyHuj1HOiTZvAh7aWPSgmjr_SY6BOMqgdfey-_RPVdFnh87qdHlRpUUMpTAguxsjEV3S3uriBAkpvJK5JBrqr1_YxkCS4LxhM56TDwIQG57dqJfQj6jBMukXrT5lyj1wFArzqtZgBNpy6YN8Qcvzfh8xDOzcJBbT5bpEwYk5Em7Ze7BlpRjcEVtdlDusqJ3MKuWTbz3Aak6Rf-d-ZiujCAff-Deyqz9MbHBhVhz7Rk58KK_C3UisrdFb5d5p3kvacEI1lEudSpyt3__HRYV62dnsPLi7IfLpLI2If4-UN0MEdxcBPU0HBHM-xSOz-f_axxbCTCLNuqhJ9Xqmvxj9D6i4Bi8DI3g1mV9hJyu1K5elwe54=w1066-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DccHvaO7p9GQTTF-s7BSEuu1f09tBv5byt5HRvmiC1X5qwjjYjka0jIt2XRd17LDKrA89MMWUlUbAiATTnn885xD71WQk8GLactaEhD9Au_2A9u3jPmf5SxLOsF30s-BBK7rJV74arY9ukvy7JKdBXSXTCTbaWsugEqtCkKqisxZ7Q38gMNr_ldcI5YXdGX_YMc2U8vsnt0-f6b7UTeRFrG8ZQcorb73Dr6e9wUoXj9mW5CcHtU974kEphjE2S20jg6Ic3Tlh6uIGGGCgIq1rfKX-SDV_EJJjzZuw6_tEF165YmTFKYm45QRHTISYOdX3Y-yivhVP0n4LYS_I_ONebJKXFI8Et5rpSrzwAfd_5XAWFKndfg3OXOfxRjJxJHFQqZNS-SuLLgRD_Lf3Cju6bohHtdF3Ep_CVJsIzC9RlxOGDcf1hvDJ4x-5JTDxFjIl49TlnSck5WOVZcLv_op1UHT29lK3F2vyrtCBzQr23gPHbnAtsGZ3XfBAhpXnsAIqTwS78kfhTxP09yzxkqJC53BWRjOw7LX0VkmsenhcaA=w1219-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6-XH7ZKlmIcPA_phRPNrGTPUyYOedOekBWJ4IXWVUGoO9RI_X029Ex536-KF_GUNRHnj1KWse-1X0Qa7_4yDAMA3oWzF3hOK2GzobeHIZ3im7Ra2ijoYZxT0k9pdrTguhPNQ5AnuWK-l8UuQrCOU0thlZ7Ria07k5BO1ave5cHn629D-8D-5BFwoBZlbeY3B-C8uYi2oU__gke4nWPQ7nQcZh4C8F2RuhFQCQo63mdPKZW0YUz4KyMnlGvah2MUsN7s9asLe1yI37nxABs9qk07pyn_SUPv0-gaipIQp1PJ3QVLxn9iv7Y1YoeKE_lG3-7leZql4jjHPpyifHT0XE0uIqn3qb8AHIvHwMjIRQkfi5yDiXsiSNmVwXncuQ0leharLFP2hP8i-xaQHNKrTXj7WrTSW4BuwKQIxI9wY3MY3E-arfGDgj-x95gxfDjNi9Hk9XAafzkcTLxm_m1-cVhAq4xSkC0bSgReH0jGEaTq529_AjtfCgTBqPrhU9BqanZ1q1KbReIld6flwMOpoCVWy8-C1NK5PcTydbVmUPL0=w630-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kVYwXAi9d_yRZfefjmlAh8XbxB6_mCkA0LOV0TKh8LRhs8KDFzI-I5ejOjMFcUNL8ZOwDxLJ4y31gLKbxRYK_MZj7PFqOEpLGmDyNewv_HUegtkj3hxxbME-TjQqh7xYZsNFxXDyNm4O6D_Gx8fWcpR2rCIyjW3EUSKZSg4GJqitxe6JyD8UXksFpjvE2H_2by2edxrKe0WWfcMY2NnPNIKqCQgQLRe80n5bADoQPrnvewfRgGylx8zdiOkSg3847KRRn69mM68KeLCBEEkQ3uQD0HNsJGyLI5Z6WhfYO3nvK2ZRC8-9iGJVBC5mn6RhFFdJelGHkVAEnr892AcsoK5Oq55Rlc_sXq0vpeCOffaedXyzQ22LhKRL4dUEAjNS6SSr19JPZEZ13mC5aaft5wc344eW3HpgQwdYJoziARJaVKeSiAmSCIj-E46ZQe_Zkl0A4OU8IbE50UlfISIhGtDarJlxVFxe6MF7cbJhkNfgmizJUnPx18HPeQmDWZnB-ARHbXuM2A-lSn-W5dIV24jTUB5MjU_WR2N-kQwxGR0=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gc6McTlggdN78YgxoSF8I21OUXre_BBV3Jvr9itdoWcZT7JWmb4mXtg90JJiiQ2NfxwJ8rPXUoawX4cLxEJmytOY59PkozIzrbf0z1fGiWGeDj3vRyChC-PGqDaQU9h_RqzQkuZXANbotiQ8WeW-juw3CdN7oU7xT65gmkK3kaAQHFDkFdJwr_BwC7Q5S4es42nc9KV5n9PPSC57EGKb5r0U8gVbvTXyxq_zXNCgEEBFsJlfd-cRL8EBnTFbj4geLjPEcrnXxlJfn3_dR2ydbnhohVrcoBZSOhZvwHkl4MfwCMghYgpNP5UTUz39l6vrVEFYKrlrCTu-LceHuU44qx3IbhrMhG3psvP_che56urdwNWMWbnetnfw5XMx-xpQFUbuuTAe3DImsccL-7sUmanT1hf9viNiNn9Xx89CPSJjgv16NdHOLDqUPzA3n5SeTrq4cvhh7HlnTEgDlCDnnMVtzb2WM1ckghBfrkkwrpyzmfaDQjeHr2_Mv6Zfbnfm5F530ntF3t6Wl7dE6XEL3kUpUqg8kfwSs8pVvRZq3SY=w278-h156-no');

(14, 'Capella', 42.8, 12.2, 'Auriga', '<p>Capella is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga, the sixth brightest in the night sky and the third brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus and Vega. Its name is derived from the diminutive of the Latin capra "goat", hence "little goat". Capella also bears the Bayer designation Alpha Aurigae (often abbreviated to α Aurigae, α Aur or Alpha Aur). Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, it is actually a star system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright, large type-G giant stars, both with a radius around 10 times that of the Sun and two and a half times its mass, in close orbit around each other. Designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, these two stars have both exhausted their core hydrogen fuel and become giant stars, though it is unclear exactly what stage they are on the stellar evolutionary pathway. The second pair, around 10,000 astronomical units from the first, consists of two faint, small and relatively cool red dwarfs. They are designated Capella H and Capella L. The stars labelled Capella C through to G and I through to K are actually unrelated stars in the same visual field. The Capella system is relatively close, at only 42.8 light-years (13.1 pc) from Earth.</p>\r\n<p>Professor William Wallace Campbell of the Lick Observatory announced that Capella was binary in 1899, based on spectroscopic observations—he noted on photographic plates taken from August 1896 to February 1897 that a second spectrum appeared superimposed over the first, and that there was a doppler shift to violet in September and October and to red in November and February—showing that the components were moving toward and away from the Earth (and hence orbiting each other). Almost simultaneously, British astronomer Hugh Newall had observed its composite spectrum with a four prism spectroscope attached to a 25-inch telescope at Cambridge in July 1899, concluding that it was a binary star system.</p>\r\n<p>Many observers tried to discern the component stars without success. Known as "The Interferometrist''s Friend", it was first resolved interferometrically in 1919 by John Anderson and Francis Pease at Mount Wilson Observatory, who published an orbit in 1920 based on their observations. This was the first interferometric measurement of any object outside the Solar System. A high-precision orbit was published in 1994 based on observations by the Mark III Stellar Interferometer, again at Mount Wilson Observatory. Capella also became the first astronomical object to be imaged by a separate element optical interferometer when it was imaged by the Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope in September 1995.</p>\r\n<p>In 1914, Finnish astronomer Ragnar Furuhjelm observed that the spectroscopic binary mentioned above had a faint companion star, which, as its proper motion was similar to that of the spectroscopic binary, was probably physically bound to it. In February 1936, Carl L. Stearns observed that this companion appeared to be double itself; this was confirmed in September that year by Gerard Kuiper.</p>\r\n<p>Capella appears to be a rich yellowish-white color. However, during daylight observation with a telescope, the yellow color is more apparent due to the contrast against the blue sky. It is the brightest star in the constellation Auriga, the sixth brightest star in the night sky, the third brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus and Vega), and the fourth brightest star visible to the naked eye from the latitude 40° N. Capella was the brightest star in the night sky from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in magnitude. At −1.1, Aldebaran was brightest before this period, and it and Capella were situated rather close to each other and served as boreal pole stars at the time.</p>\r\n<p>In Bayer''s 1603 work Uranometria, Capella marks the charioteer''s back. It lies a few degrees to the northeast from the triangle of stars known as "The Kids" (Epsilon, Zeta, and Eta Aurigae). Capella is closer to the north celestial pole than any other first magnitude star Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°north: for the whole of the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, most of France, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are on opposite sides of the pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris.</p>\r\n<p>Two Aerobee-Hi rocket flights on September 20, 1962, and March 15, 1963, apparently detected and confirmed an X-ray source in Auriga at RA 05<sup>h</sup> 09<sup>m</sup> Dec +45°. It was identified as Capella which is in the error box. Capella was much more readily detected on the second rocket flight. Stellar X-ray astronomy started on April 5, 1974, with the detection of X-rays from Capella. A rocket flight on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at Capella. During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2–1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor. The X-ray luminosity (L<sub>x</sub>) of ~10<sup>24</sup> W (10<sup>31</sup> erg s<sup>−1</sup>) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun''s X-ray luminosity.</p>\r\n<p>Capella is a source of X-rays, thought to be primarily from the corona of the more massive star. Capella is ROSAT X-ray source 1RXS J051642.2+460001. The high temperature of Capella''s corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using HEAO 1 required magnetic confinement unless it was a free-flowing coronal wind.</p>\r\n<p>The Capella system consists of a bright binary of giant stars, orbiting at some distance from a fainter binary of red dwarfs. The two main stars are Capella Aa and Capella Ab, whereas their faint companions are Capella H and Capella L—the stars labelled Capella C through to G are actually unrelated stars in the same visual field. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 76.20 milliarcseconds (with a margin of error of 0.46 milliarcseconds) as measured by the Hipparcos satellite, this system is estimated to be 42.8 light-years (13.12 parsecs) from Earth, with a margin of error of 0.3 light-years (0.09 parsecs).</p>\r\n<p>In a 1960 paper, American astronomer Olin J. Eggen discerned that Capella was a member of the Hyades moving group, a group of stars moving in the same direction as the Hyades cluster, by analysing its proper motion and parallax. Members of the group are of a similar age, and those that are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun have moved off the main sequence and are expanding and cooling into red giants. He adopted the spectral values of G8III and G0III, but was concerned the hotter star''s properties were not consistent with its companion if of the same age, and that it might have already been a red giant and be heating up once more.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NPObld-VIWri2qV2qGrYZ-e0M8_P1wJiBde2KF3yUdGbEoPDkxQjeJg8OenlVzMANH3t6Wv3Sr47CRWWB6akuhF-S4YVMJxN7VJYuzaxft93EDovgGPcbnRSp7bwiOjurHVtNgITLeMyHTd7wKLebi622gu3YCjIvNESD8Y__xJmRC4IZvpzqNJdw8RfJMDr8q-fcgDbSnFTNLUMOVUyDGgBhvUIVsYI_wT9GH4NFfvm0wciRHOXBDSMorn8MXhB4vF3gia_M5XJLRciwSrt-bgXYseyGjQkmUue3oqwoUF4lEMUvu3qInOsPH25sIhJ3ebWCSe8CZwdhMhqYIXnFdMf3cs3QRUH8VanAhopp4qUHfFLb_NyvCBSlWF_NuHK5QyC0e_AbKZIDAx747ILD-oZfKb6g2TLEO8USy6USgeHQfy6JaDCywjDJvVnUbOnEqNsgh1q4_PWW5whCeJRKBnFfUl3_8NdhKECsxfwuEr7y-Ing2RONo06yBMxQoMVGq0L6ZchuydsGDCHUMb3xTimSx5ab11s94ZU0xlefaE=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Z1RjPkSQF2X1JyNdKQtoMlnswW5OzkO5KV6W82kQ1k7uOzzTieswLexcV05XOhX1SxBTGNghty1cQ8uQ09IDnwPApL7qXbmvbylNz6l_o9TmSwbFRWlxiGu4v9kgYOa3F8-bMGZ2Ubpc6NdKdMVRAoF2HlPRzj79XIYi0FX1xji-f_2aAqSWWwH2oFIyj2XrqFQB7vwQEoFgzqMvfO8NKAyZVodZEIslsS0nAuTxRp7s3idP2E4Jt_Tnipztaso77pedvfGsOY5Qs52_ixHSvNr-jWoCihHskRHqDlglY4aY-RkwMYPZLLnuNRMZo4TZZSDCIHLrxmQjNyyO81jYCYKV6Exq5oMdFg06q98bS8Db_zY0jVfhkhv-uSx5cdfWyBbTwujMn1pLK6Edpnqf4XgXT7drtRzr3VYycBwPLgOOf6rD9t6MrrZf8vqOrYVD9X6LPsEayNBBk2XP5tO33rjWbnDtdNT9GCUp6xCTlcnOdYtrVUnj50AqtdeuyH_KNlXmjk9KaQRkOJiHKnv6aUTRoGrIH82YsBUs-JAsX1Q=w1203-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hHr6VXS0FnmkZFo9ywdPDFDRe-s_ImveULKzbQ81otLuMP43aHj8KKfnksGmo5egKFr-_uMuZlBJOckMPP8_LNUDd2JKJjcXhJdL35sJ5pLQvK-WRWAm5fz0qQ1L0Erf4GIe3pGGRbfmyYi3KGemsx4CSQlEVXq3wP-6HCVUoE4Ym9Q1KxS2J33rA1qQ1qJ2oh9AdZMXsVtjy638jpArIhJNA8lrn-XK0I56ra_xnZz0lHc380Bqo1smA5w-LWzTmBL9n_5XJC8zT8BlIUHwBVYh_pq9JtOdGQlWt_fV7CxK5f7Qjl9WWXqSmkxyBeL_L1hkD9tLw1AIUpiIRnEabx6SjyBmTYyYybyONRZLMl4duBq-yMimFGwWz7RsnKsy-A7GvkX4J7KlYNkyq4taHVQVw767rx4Sa5iVYOAcKze8zLrFUc8eGjjS2zpF1ZZdYb7L1dsxKuToJZZWsRoQS-4ILuPI0ALgg-iLBWNqzSBAILsGqXwR8yipv9reW8OaoBDsaDXBDOC5JR-9Dq_XdCbSInwzm9o-0-hhbpnbsDo=s799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bOU9jfpTWuaQN9G1YrHX3g56eVM5CmoXiAILABOjnyc2K4bvododex_HmGLD3GdodXWXJINZnoU2gZkSevI6sXl9JRde9lmF3Qwx0HK_4jM0twTrpX55NKuBY1ufiWDznst3zrCtSmzYQ-ItD5j6JE6MGMpYsFnOYrh2QHfUQ7Gc-OjOXtyu6ljBSOvjSZlgJa4sPV5uJTOpdExAnUr8m7R7pZXAuUGW03omx88J7NDUNbjlU_9wEeitIRGcEB-pk5yXTpzlYgzppjebHklMYj_quEGph7WmlasC_Xt1wMKHKkICYuUp0-5uEWE2EKN6fsMsOrKqXkcHWGcSaNdlMqhslr_MTKGpmUeC7XwGMpaU7MvLc2A_Pv1feXXI6ZWBs52Te52t0Qt1mc5_EhEwwL5BUHgL889vqXCfJeDLvc6TRXCoa-IJsXDQiPL9fm4o_hAuF7pwue2rEHd2Q6mJ5P7brbsHvBSXkNKJlY3Oia3H1DxsXDCGlH1afp5dHEJ2dMmN6HlKEgKijd1IKz2ytt7w4vNZhJpqVXWIWwzYEC8=w1355-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MMdOQncNh5A2mtkLhETvX2Dks4kUNfqTAyy7HFKoqo9iBm1yRmXqXGLSx5_rtfHJ8ooRsLaNSFwasuQ9PmzrYaIkfSDvYz9-_MNX7cNtYbKS7vvUz1PxJa1ydFBBnoSKHQDdCuCq0iimixauDfwJvoBNQTsjHF4MVa6wsBA3tR-aLU-aBBID7DXJB-_ViJqgezhj0RZefUINiGE1QwpYAJFHzyr6SCLtlaAen5GeRgrugW5SUUYE6sTuDadFqE5tkKm6omLcjo4c8Kd1PrV0n4bZE5HpI-PcxAeWrUlnpPeQlOwMFX0pa682lKdsNP3MIMK4SF0tufsu5WvhFBQUs49c9S93nKlfEw4xujSwPvjhAGeU6WcdjZPeVwDaxQis3o6ydvsYECBwXuNSAp_-yDL4joHfIlvUa75FDevSwucdrArQlMSSfLuGDyWDHnqyi_Hja9I0uU3uZ2f1thyhpJFEUN_l_KqA23s2caqH6N4ARAMBxdWF7jnxmc0uFjl77UWcW37h3mmnoUvhwdffnZzFzkQlLR77ByDbjGKmEVA=s799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FxgDLmJlVTgnevo03QP-8WyAXhmvB2zhr5kqz9rSmv9SzlUWqG7rlvjExg61vY4QPA0156PvLtkBoy3gs9maeKX7XtCvx8fXgM0NeP4GNf1f7FSKxOh_ScsVyhySoHkGKeC_xaYknWjIUP33XLWl4rrwsWuvEQQNRvUQgJOM3SiMj2bciZB5uvqUdYssN27H2sMQvm9lJcvwS7F7f6GI3Hip_6T2VMbvsZx_bOF92X0W82snXO8OOme2h9zSXqJ1aurBNT-iudVKyM9CgEueY5-SvFHoSR5HY9IbLCopzZ6yy1GqIX5sh1z-sbu8O4GPyrlDJ1G_8EWAMofVbqNeww0t13a-Eig2LoFID7lO844RygpZTrev2t44Hwgltd2bjjhMhJwKxbo8czlLfwC1fw2WjARIHp2NyMBVJv4E-N-U9zwC0m8pweNIJ6jqodDpjWeFy4oKgdUv7lUxfuDi7rcrPT3lhaX1ZkE_aQU3jA6cYZ-yBVBz_U48oJdFWo14KcubssQtjqFLykIemlbQ5gpk4hjuKyqg7-VDNVpBBC0=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gc6McTlggdN78YgxoSF8I21OUXre_BBV3Jvr9itdoWcZT7JWmb4mXtg90JJiiQ2NfxwJ8rPXUoawX4cLxEJmytOY59PkozIzrbf0z1fGiWGeDj3vRyChC-PGqDaQU9h_RqzQkuZXANbotiQ8WeW-juw3CdN7oU7xT65gmkK3kaAQHFDkFdJwr_BwC7Q5S4es42nc9KV5n9PPSC57EGKb5r0U8gVbvTXyxq_zXNCgEEBFsJlfd-cRL8EBnTFbj4geLjPEcrnXxlJfn3_dR2ydbnhohVrcoBZSOhZvwHkl4MfwCMghYgpNP5UTUz39l6vrVEFYKrlrCTu-LceHuU44qx3IbhrMhG3psvP_che56urdwNWMWbnetnfw5XMx-xpQFUbuuTAe3DImsccL-7sUmanT1hf9viNiNn9Xx89CPSJjgv16NdHOLDqUPzA3n5SeTrq4cvhh7HlnTEgDlCDnnMVtzb2WM1ckghBfrkkwrpyzmfaDQjeHr2_Mv6Zfbnfm5F530ntF3t6Wl7dE6XEL3kUpUqg8kfwSs8pVvRZq3SY=w278-h156-no'),
(15, 'Westerlund 1-26', 11500, 1530, 'Ara', '<p>Westerlund 1-26 or Wd 1-26 is a red supergiant or hypergiant within the outskirts of the Westerlund 1 super star cluster. It is one of the largest known stars discovered so far, although the radius is poorly known. It is approximately 1,530 solar radii, or a radius of 1,064,880,000 kilometres (661,685,755 miles; 7 AU). If placed at the center of the Solar System, its photosphere would engulf the orbit of Jupiter.</p>\r\n<p>Westerlund 1 was discovered by Bengt Westerlund in 1961 during an infrared survey in the Zone of Avoidance of the sky, described as "a heavily reddened cluster in Ara". The spectral types of the component stars could not be determined at the time except for the brightest star which was tentatively considered type M.</p> \r\n<p>In 1969, Borgman, Kornneef, and Slingerland conducted a photometric survey of the cluster and assigned letters to the stars they measured. This star, identified as a strong radio source, was given the letter "A". This leads to the designation Westerlund-1 BKS A used at Simbad, although the cluster was not known as Westerlund 1 at that time. At the time it was referred to as Ara A, with another strong radio source in the cluster called Ara C. Its brightness in the radio spectrum makes it one of the rare "radio stars". Westerlund made spectroscopic observations of the cluster, still not known as Westerlund 1, published in 1987 and numbered the stars, giving the number 26 and the spectral type M2I.</p>\r\n<p>Modern terminology stems from 1998 when the cluster was referred to as Westerlund 1 (Wd1), with a paper describing Ara A as star 26 and Ara C as star 9.</p>\r\n<p>The star is located 11,500 light-years from Earth and is almost obscured at visible wavelengths by severe extinction due to interstellar dust, hence it has been studied extensively in the longer infrared to radio wavelengths. The star has the size between over 1,500 R<sub>☉</sub> Its spectral type identifies it a red star with a high luminosity. At radio wavelengths it is 310,000 times brighter than the Sun, making its luminosity range somewhere around 380,000 times brighter than the Sun (M<sub>V</sub> -9.2).<p>\r\n<p>Westerlund 1-26 is classified as a luminous supergiant. With its surface temperature of about 3000 K, it occupies the upper right corner of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. The cool temperature means it emits most of its energy in the infrared spectrum. It also shows huge mass loss of atmospheric material, suggesting that it may further evolve into a Wolf–Rayet star. Westerlund 1-26 has been observed to change its spectral class during several periods, but it has not been seen to change its luminosity.</p>\r\n<p>In October 2013, astronomers using the European Southern Observatory''s Very Large Survey Telescope (VST) discovered that Westerlund 1-26 is surrounded by a glowing cloud of ionized hydrogen. This is the first ionized nebula to be have been discovered around a red supergiant star through its optical emission lines, and follows the discovery of an ionized nebula around NML Cyg in 1982. The nebula extends 1.30 parsecs from the star.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qtT7uLrB6FRhOfDzvZfEat_SKYaRw3J5CSkwRxrTsDSG4-YlxFzZad_oBsTH3Fu0YQzfUrEwH5ydgci72dS42I9hY0SPT7P-I2zRllRuBpkr185Hy-cGmovm5uIU9Fb3gtKuUFCLPq0RGFi2m1XPLo9V1-4BbZ_4LWVLHnDrHzGSkNIE9lDTj8SSfynqEsvs_Lb98rb45iKRxY0kF7R6-yIRmoXlgLmlhjoZJTtQdlvvku79GmzpIjE9TLn5bbK6X_dPJ9tK8MSekfesEkYNIb5n76_5RZPgQk0jDzPZgAmfWYreIZglufhqQz8FU66JMT36gyraxz6XvshjMe6OqUmO6SVPFAmmcl1XL0wY6El_BWefkxAOnNCTpesqfMpzyHM4ECL0uDCtc4q4EoGX_RATpvUaldozCn3btR3xVh0wZHZsxz0U0cE8BZa8GdDUSZ2ofctfDpcLfkRT-oYYwCj8v-GZeRRrnYSos5Ia56FhvES1TIf5-_oZuywAqhtXTINg19DpMOPQNXvgufv4JVDwxqNR6PflpdGSSvFCfnc=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MMdOQncNh5A2mtkLhETvX2Dks4kUNfqTAyy7HFKoqo9iBm1yRmXqXGLSx5_rtfHJ8ooRsLaNSFwasuQ9PmzrYaIkfSDvYz9-_MNX7cNtYbKS7vvUz1PxJa1ydFBBnoSKHQDdCuCq0iimixauDfwJvoBNQTsjHF4MVa6wsBA3tR-aLU-aBBID7DXJB-_ViJqgezhj0RZefUINiGE1QwpYAJFHzyr6SCLtlaAen5GeRgrugW5SUUYE6sTuDadFqE5tkKm6omLcjo4c8Kd1PrV0n4bZE5HpI-PcxAeWrUlnpPeQlOwMFX0pa682lKdsNP3MIMK4SF0tufsu5WvhFBQUs49c9S93nKlfEw4xujSwPvjhAGeU6WcdjZPeVwDaxQis3o6ydvsYECBwXuNSAp_-yDL4joHfIlvUa75FDevSwucdrArQlMSSfLuGDyWDHnqyi_Hja9I0uU3uZ2f1thyhpJFEUN_l_KqA23s2caqH6N4ARAMBxdWF7jnxmc0uFjl77UWcW37h3mmnoUvhwdffnZzFzkQlLR77ByDbjGKmEVA=s799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xFspD-s6amF6BW72w1Subm77Y2liReF8PfWH4n1qhNJO4QWXzsYCJf4605p4i3FTdu8gahTn1_sRfOrIcgGEF7oSnWySapTDF16MOO5jtpZKi6t7Lc6wik5TTlDuZVp3ChP7Cdqlx2vwLmMYApjpUhAN2090X7QLrtgREoI4gJEcWnyNV92HkTOT6g9NaGyyzXdzeEkOKazn0CC4D0Fvs7X__m4DewFHOi3ElPQCYOyWCPDhnLhTl_FWOA8IARQtUyvamxuxR3eBT_CbIdMBVAPgx8YPfWRIVePonOZ-x9QqVGBSsb3RxtoHTmuz5ectKZEEYyRDmElemEH3uxhs9953En3_kYE4WzAtZaee330vE11fXTE1sHm2Hpp9iWBgEYtw99OFcHJMtMQS551CR7vUTESCChCVOKp519lBNwteeXOm61hd9KLXAU5YgYWwJlqh_hva28G2DJOzlFX7CacyxINi34_DMiGdnMYjkqsbTJITH86iDgryCSV6f5OGorU098p_Oj0D4CpkiyEX9xe16ZSH9jE8X-Vxn5Xp-Ek=w1249-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PIoXaEjmr9HIGlRZCx2nXi7EJkc5Y1QTE9o1xkVRqeQYkdh8PgaGpBjAZCoKi68DfwZUlePHemQfAK455CMXnBWfd4fBq_Zc6dxolWH4-IPWSsJkEeUgSmGfCLVd1Q_Mo8djqS9vgFlCixFhNWYyadIWj-dEQxbm3yjTQcIiQdI0emhfNI7eb6Ox5FQTUdMG_KTYEzs7-z8tw6uGXBHhu6pKpHXh-rzPR_7n_HFmALBQQXfMGITUu1BA0WHVsVHvwVK_tBfgSoBmLfCybgzo-S__-BDjEbSujI7x4MxMuu8YKPjdQJeToPtOzWLHq84RhERSykedVGeOp7lruO7DnEh2knB9qHdRqd8rtJ78pu5f82_ASxaYw-l4OH1cjQxl0bX-Y1PuCvUkm-L9B0xjBUkFlfDrjctTi9P4NvJsbALGPVCFoPtSqjUTo5nBqlcbPo4jtLt5cY9aAW2V73z97Dx8ZBa11zwRu5tZOxWdG-ZmVOplCRcNpNLgCaJQCMlL0-hhnPIAV9h89NlA_EOjkLPszyEYoFzdZbhcr2_y4Zk=w1279-h800-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/syyPi2Uhuq6TA2svqDwncNAdn_0IvUrMAXhSqkIBIKv9pabJBF4VVJfbJr3MNHKfGozyibnqIbIY4UJErOndl0FjHlL_B98AUIY2zIYOljyjYRVrv2I1yk22z3uF1HoeDyid4GswYvWhcBceGgLT2NdeZI-XL4Yx_qvYUDYMCOBf9dEJq1eXCTimIoDbdAVZ4lC742pBZ6F_ieXrGs0qbV4ZYH5hg-VTqcoacjDwyhTTkWUA0_P5m-6o_ftAHKuy0xYKBaqbcjUqdc8W0pxIPP6ui9sWuMo0XlqIa3f85piFkS1m33KDaKLBasw5LrkFrmvX2XYFqiBy7R7VrM2iUVyWyRg3hOT6CYdgIOykMbjkMGUvTKFqn9_HkCerOu7m-1x-OGDp3BH-MUzXUsAmUDde1DwIoKwtYmicdlTXFrnkOUj6axebiNkCDjPKYG-K9hhbuKE-40amDnwY4ZWjiRCQgJIHNeDhdCVUAvWLQLe4n538MjnhzB9eg6vaASb9Cy4d54nlD0c4HebByfMCoUiXlHwyrwY8XUD4do-n0rg=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IniEkikGpUsRvToOgLhqWR0ZpGYKdx1e140YZfdzJSjsGdpHcBjewGV9NqgvobeRSbIWfRkMP2LW6cEBDfeZA3xn4eQVXXRc2SZ6nmB8ow6JdE2KtKmz1Vq9QYQ_th6m5YUkDqEG8kT3p-tk1tM4YBd19zo2G8QiPQZKlTNxuoGyX8xv-gAIdyX4yKedlltNC14hummdG2U_XL06nHy5cdz2iMdjEB259haZcer7Nw8djCL0F7HzS2RGYIU5CHkqYOZK-t-kdj71Po6AmD_jOqrmkrYfBzbV5p5dNAqjPWRhxUKqIAtZLZj5_qBQw1qqxvLwBssZ8RiBUM1wbr3umjbelQSbhYYj9myrlWi2qoO9jm3YjNvmFLrQHkOI8HGYKZeODGsNflpWt02HeXMQlahVjwzEVdMd8TAqDoKD5jXrHc-e3ZdPKzZNrwgLmmOlo3j8CnNxob2doIID3k-2SRD2DkuOdgMtpCP0q4ewETgS8v8R6_5qMrMMp4RxGCoB344IOmXk8m8-2eKg7R_LzDNQh-P0DfYKAgKHMKnYBT4=w278-h156-no'),
(16, 'NML Cygni', 1610, 2208, 'Cygnus', '<p>NML Cygni or V1489 Cygni is a red hypergiant and one of the largest stars currently known with a radius about 1,650 times the Sun''s, equal to a diameter of 15.3 astronomical units. Its distance from Earth is estimated to be around 1.6 kpc, about 5,300 light-years.</p>\r\n<p>NML Cygni is a part of the Cygnus OB2 association, one of the closest massive associations to the Sun, spanning nearly 2° on the sky or ~30 pc in radius at the distance of 1.74 ± 0.2 kpc.</p>\r\n<p>NML Cygni was discovered in 1965 by Neugebauer, Martz, and Leighton who described two extremely red luminous stars, their colour being described as consistent with a black body temperature of 1,000 K. The name NML comes from the names of these three discoverers. The second star was briefly referred to as NML Tauri but is now known as IK Tauri, an M9 Mira variable. NML Cygni has since also been given the designation V1489 Cygni on account of the small semi-regular brightness variations, but is still most commonly referred to as NML Cygni. Its composition began to be revealed with the discovery of OH masers (1612 MHz) in 1968. Molecules like H<sub>2</sub>O, SiO, CO, HCN, CS, SO, SO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>S have also been detected.</p>\r\n<p>The diameter of NML Cygni, at 1,650 times that of the Sun, is about 2,295,000,000 kilometres (1.426×10<sup>9</sup> mi). If placed at the center of the Solar System, its surface would extend beyond the orbit of Jupiter, filling over half the gap between Jupiter and Saturn''s orbit. It contains a volume approximately 4.5 billion times that of the Sun. The bolometric luminosity (L<sub>bol</sub>) for NML Cygni is near 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> L<sub>☉</sub>. Its bolometric magnitude (M<sub>bol</sub>) is around −9.0. It is one of the most luminous cool hypergiants, as well as one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way. It is also a semiregular variable star with a period of around 940 days.</p>\r\n<p>NML Cygni is evolved and a number of heavy elements and molecules have been detected in its atmosphere, particularly oxygen, hydroxyl, and water. It is surrounded by dusty material and it exhibits a bean-shaped asymmetric nebula that is coincident with the distribution of its H<sub>2</sub>O vapor masers.</p>\r\n<p>NML Cygni has an estimated mass loss rate of 2×10<sup>−4</sup> M<sub>☉</sub> per year, one of the highest known for any star. The annual parallax of NML Cygni is measured to be around 0.62 milli-arc-seconds. From the observations, it is estimated that NML Cygni has two discrete optically thick envelopes of dust and molecules. The optical depth of the inner shell is found to be 1.9, while that of the outer one is 0.33. These dust envelopes are formed due to the strong post-main-sequence wind, which has a velocity 23 km/s.</p>\r\n<p>Because of its position on the outskirts of the massive Cygnus OB2 association, the detectable effects of NML Cygni''s radiation on the surrounding dust and gas are limited to the region away from the central hot stars of the association.</p>\r\n\r\n', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/01J3Es7McdIH_KoKh-WtZDZtIsdihuFyZY8wbSY30r93qZGfbnIV7KTytJ6EeQ0di68L9dercuWlINgoikmhPG4TX33KaoytQPUkylt03aoD7Uh1xAS3JFHIX50Jthrv6dVN9s2YA-FA6t8e2dSmu173dcrWZAqRkEX_CQ6FB7m-UQxEnLGKTMa_6GlVsjaaNg6nZoCu4LSZ2BpcyOIxPvdI1LFKFDxDJYCGhsZeD3n4TsqsrWOsFejGjRc7_FHftyrPXeib-N9IN_WzSdRbbxwRqdG5TgjVwqa0vFmKX8POpAdw5afGtasNpeT71s4L_3E_CplzUI_0quTQ9gL51XnoxJWRDEQpVfdnpbkxVEckdzkN1XRlxwXRr0zbaXrdGgFsiUik0cJ9PnzagI2gQzIVl1vaT3GMjconI9cTR8e_VqLoVzElf892WkpdkG5-hMzqMgvuRN9kAAuktyk236qUwHjyLXzkEe7igzrCIMrM9YbbQXVg7rNrtL9xBQyfKjpcfD56Uc8s0jNlo0DV0QDxgZQZoSUXFF-PkdRZyhw=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BueudkfcYAti8WWkh29IrUTeKSniRjy7IYW_EZ-M1gnunr2IArJtGZqYi77JkUhLDGUxed1bSVG-XaODZ59b20XpAsedLT16bZe6WG9iA6uBtsKa8UwXgdCUkGOuP2wMi6NEeKNTOA67cJ-L43SAFJCJPPIKCwpMxuvw0Fo2mf0vHWIJOKgq4sUwdYfsSuISuUzZeflwWh98uTg3p215FnHDK1sMqbGXSEkPEb4Dwd6LbLGcAmpj3FO73mnuvcAMkSYOr04oCU-YI2eEUTnZGqgeZJZQ2cUThcj4tUm-ZrtMAkl50Hl9PJD7ESvxnt8HIivL5WRNOF5qgNtYkYa0FbS5QRoc91Qxs8SQ-mOqW8wERAlBbknrvS_uvOz0SVehmdBPv_DDWzKIlEAxq-cGnE-FLfWWplR3mACunttOyI6D95TE707Hhln385CtEGPi8OAKLHttdSlbQGfKhAKA_-L9kqzz3VjeQTCb_Lv_CZWzxJRmioQ-njIDuMlfp62vaOSfGtote11BwJQcc9uip2DZodAUOTEOVFJZ2NtbMzM=w1218-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nJoUpJBYvbDBoOKuYzW5BfL6iTY41xFQZV98qnavsrzv83j7c2UtuXAQO6ZXMjRb_IwqQSSPpayvEf7foxvATHftYPXwNHnkzYlwi20pNCYkqHXnV1Ifa5zdNq50DS-5SAX4WkXI1Bo_SH1-Lv6hImrtquZrOXhHzNwQrc1cXeZ-h57A6BcHHKHy7odw5krIM_UnwUwi6892woE3zBKOhJIz6sqslCKCoyIndrP2f4-weVPQBPuFQIm8LlDMi6de_UtxQP2XF9QFQyta7KwQ-yZ16qHxBoq459XG-xzQ8wj1edBG-9ZVzt2aPfj0q_DTfGz43ZgMD-YCc8Obx5KDwxW2PuKypJZOqWBQI625CDR1gWRTDx1RaV5bxBMbE1O8W5m0agTzHLl86LfkgvYmAihl1ZJa3ZK12ixQdUnZruZxZHO3kS5_exjveM1qZqFN4PwLcdcIHdzNDQoTvNE5IB8VFirMRgHVZEfijKh53lSFMXM4EOkLrDpsVMjn_hCn6bZX7bp_AxT1Rftl5OjkmTPO_FLGlt4TQagkw6qxhhY=w742-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p1aXcDjRizA1mp5gJJu6txAji5W-_woFVqoadiLpQufrDBT-62pAz5uZc9bXY-7E2pxAkd-CAP_3An_tAy8N_bjCCnw5DTI70fg1gsMq9CXlilNubzmLcVbWblVCau9kRDAqf4YWZy8msjT81PNDjfRg_xZ005UmFr6-qZoPKt4DlsOlLIwWzVrMVLuUXeH0_qVERPjX5c7zYI55Cyoa_3bnvQG00OwHDZTsUfSaqeiu_coNwu5eg2jlDCqujqo_tj8TDVNUBclfA_D2QdnoTfGk-xV2Hi7AJJK4rKve2_0Y3w2QOmoZuerASTcV_R2LLNu3aBA3LEDGpLM8-Y1gOz5NFC1eUzvCTja2_itRpp4lNhr8ZRvGGivhh7WpLfqMBayVBtJAUulbQT6a9Ox1ZnRNuFKrLVRc-9kswIeJ4SCR4Xo_TlzZrT1T5wkVAB3d0G5VcNXVZiNz1HWi2ZYGbFL2pvcVc_MQ5rdjVmSbOkWJ-LrJpDzFj7K852G1syKVmwxY4G-prP0GmuicIPQnvJqp_inKWwjZ7SG50ITQKNQ=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v7Scy7d65DIW_kG0s31MYltbJ0K3Ne2b7ctTsrMlT0MMSMQaamhsXMGb3Uz2CRFkPba2D_8jAEsHd145IRvYLmu1xj_aw4-l4yQS5FguGjD_q72NauY-fSAG7Ycc9rYCZzsw-EDW1paksxYjwB2kwjV2Z0shkHV0zUna-bLOEECQ29ZUpEP6263nQubStGpFCY8n79J3oPOgOHeMLgkGE9p6yb3GbBFupVT0VuWKwO2sHNWQbsPv88tgC4LoPSAkZsB-fC0Gia2uulUwSZWnR4XTrHuPCh4e38ypJq3cp3Hhj4bXnTN23KdrI-1yMY4eP0kjuEsWx1zyISDn3uLaNHjstXBLXJw53m1-dM7iVkgAjquwoV9TOIlH5UWJEKVff_ogYQVATAM5trvFHY6gbo8IihJgRj7eO4KCV0-HrMq0G4WVWY9dEpOjYG1MweY1HeuIxDcpNcj5LCGAgOwKYlxYzDWGrbzhsqpMvIHG_1Xtdx78T5vh1QHGRQpjXKbdPoDebg2oNizY4p35QdkJYrKzxO5ObrPR93CX0rWQqnU=w278-h156-no'),
(17, 'UY Scuti', 9500, 1708, 'Scutum', '<p>UY Scuti is a bright red supergiant and pulsating variable star in the constellation Scutum. It is one of the leading candidates for being the largest known star by radius and is also one of the most luminous of its kind. It has an estimated average median radius of 1,708 solar radii, or a diameter of 2.4 billion km (1.5 billion mi; 15.9 AU); thus a volume 5 billion times that of the Sun. It is approximately 2.9 kiloparsecs (9,500 light years) from Earth. If placed at the center of the Solar System, its photosphere would engulf the orbit of Jupiter, although the radius is not known for certain and may be larger than the orbit of Saturn.</p>\r\n<p>UY Scuti was first catalogued in 1860 by German astronomers at the Bonn Observatory during the first sky survey of stars for the Bonner Durchmusterung Stellar Catalogue. At its discovery it was named BD -12 5055, the 5,055th star between 12°S and 13°S counting from 0h right ascension. By that time the Durchmusterung Catalogue was one of the most comprehensive stellar catalogues of the sky, and the data of the survey was released in 1862.</p>\r\n<p>On the next detection of the star in the second survey it was found to change slightly in brightness, suggesting that it was a new variable star. In accordance with the international standard of designation of variable stars, it was called UY Scuti, the 38th variable star of the constellation Scutum (see variable star designation).</p>\r\n<p>Under exceptionally good conditions with no light pollution, UY Scuti can be seen using a small telescope or large binoculars as a reddish star with a faint smudge along the stars of the Milky Way. It is located a few degrees north of the A-type naked-eye star Gamma Scuti, and 2 arcminutes northwest of the Eagle Nebula. Although the star is very luminous it is, at its brightest, only 11th magnitude as viewed from Earth, due to its distance and location in the Zone of Avoidance within the Cygnus rift.</p>\r\n<p>The star is classified as a semiregular variable with an approximate pulsation period of 740 days. It has the total bolometric power of 340,000 L☉, making it one of the most luminous stars in the galaxy.</p>\r\n<p>Despite its large size, UY Scuti is not classified as a hypergiant. There is an MKK luminosity class 0 (zero) for hypergiants, but this is rarely seen in published spectral classifications. More commonly, hypergiants are classed as Ia-0, Ia+, or even just Iae based solely on the observed spectra and red supergiants rarely receive these extra spectral classifications. A high luminosity and large size are insufficient for it to be defined as a hypergiant. That requires the detection of the spectral signatures of atmospheric instability and high mass loss. In the case of UY Scuti, its spectrum has the presence of spectral lines of carbon, water, and silicon oxide, but it does not show any spectral lines of oxygen, neon, and other heavier elements, indication of an insufficient mass loss rate. Furthermore, its location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is below the oval region of hypergiants, making it only classified as a bright red supergiant.</p>\r\n<p>In the summer of 2012, astronomers from the Very Large Telescope in the Atacama Desert in Chile measured the parameters of three supergiants near the Galactic Center region: UY Scuti, AH Scorpii, and KW Sagittarii. They determined that all three stars are 1,000 times bigger than the Sun, making them some of the largest stars known. The stars'' sizes were defined using the Rosseland Radius, the location at which the optical depth is one (or sometimes a different value such as 2/3).</p>\r\n<p>UY Scuti was found to be the largest of the three stars measured, at 1,708 ± 192 R<sub>☉</sub>. This makes the star''s radius the largest known of any star and approximately 1.7 times the size of the famous Betelgeuse. The star is so immense that if the Earth were the size of a 20 cm (8 in) diameter beach ball, the Sun would be about 22 m (73 ft) in diameter (around the height of a 7-story office building), while UY Scuti would have a diameter of 38,000 m (125,000 ft), over four times the height of Mount Everest.</p>\r\n<p>UY Scuti''s mass is also uncertain, primarily because it has no visible companion star by which its mass can be measured through gravitational interference. Stellar evolutionary models conclude that the initial mass of a star (the mass of a star when it is formed) reaching the red supergiant stage like UY Scuti would have been around 25 M<sub>☉</sub> (possibly up to 40 M<sub>☉</sub> for a non-rotating star), and has probably lost more than half of that.</p>\r\n<p>Based on current models of stellar evolution, UY Scuti has begun to fuse helium and continues to fuse hydrogen in a shell around the core. The location of UY Scuti deep within the Milky Way disc suggests that it was an extreme Population I, or a very metal rich star, which is relatively short-lived.</p>\r\n<p>UY Scuti should fuse lithium, carbon, oxygen, neon, and silicon in its core within the next million years. After this, its core will begin to produce iron, disrupting the balance of gravity and radiation in its core and resulting in a core collapse supernova. It is expected that stars like UY Scuti should evolve back to hotter temperatures to become a yellow hypergiant, luminous blue variable, or a Wolf–Rayet star, creating a strong stellar wind that will eject its outer layers and expose the core, before exploding as a type IIb, IIn, or type Ib/Ic supernova.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DC1tAJSVpnM3PoPMqrR36wsj2l0ddeGPtFF0PnkEP1_dRm4IWTjAtRzx4hrVN0AS-X71CUtqRUB5Bj_uwHJ3dPAeMRHjB_NOjDoWVfaml2oYlUd1WAi6Wx8LS7Qik01e1UVdfdmFIXResCMFtV9UYzwQMokFzen1HCLKQ9XCiJg2D4wPBh-tzLX290XdUXov6CjCu6d5y8u5wpXM0qU2_k6dA_eDy_iuyFygIidNS7Tj5icvSuQ_BUcJsbsD2yt2Hbf54QESR5sTM_irQDRs3nAoERjZHzOLHgGa11I4Vk3AZHbjLf6H4sfpOpAkNXCzvz54akJh2XBakasUevOWCvzoQg919VSvn8j_Pwb2qXVIp3DOaNSDZ2yN_CJSRBFLhqMhoGQT5SAMPOifIiSDpN9jHD4oil34P3xTEMbHIkhDNnkje6tJ81drmy7zYEZMPlTExnGHerWQfgsG5BdCv0qs0eVTMWgPazV1N0HIfZGtKh1QFlKgzSNus_OKa1HGoxuZfGZxMd6Ekfap9eXq3Xk41Jq0RytN6eGqm9gZ9WM=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HTMid40xd3uME_So8mfcAEwHcGtBNfj1fS5GHq-WXlCJj1dbJiLaA3FHZygDmhtSSJVZafscuTxoZ1fxp7AySIZtrb9bMP23s3aNz7oSMcmmt7VngvKF24mX2hCT7eY1zUxXShwsSA4xpeSWaOcDkePXRTsLPOJN2ra_ktRtog8XPpYPeJBYokAJFTDwkR0aH9f_3TxCkGkMTfxhSRdGdRl2yh3AQrOFp3cInpxys5QkWeCarYA5QwrKprXbJ7WnYJ98FNcRq6_jOOURwQzxbnv3bw0auONLrGbYyqE-tp3CbjCl8dhLCX2HDvx9_QlJviO5nugpJXoCoEmgava6lrVgnNMo8HWQxAvKZt6dK6Hw3m3VROUSIYmOqrDcrrfN6lwoEHRzo8y7f93AK_px2B8Ii5jrtZ-mS8_Azhcsjw662wXYOYPPUFbShKsD0SLNn8kx7BCR-Z1BucoubeaMPFEIo9n-I6gfJ7N-Rze1Qnsm5gTFqZ80jLoFKxSQVVbYk0yVoGzE1YQRV5qwMfYoXe9ikfDXgEVIl-mtFnDEB70=w580-h378-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uAxnqoA9zpcecV4-7bnbkkiY7DNgIj2-_ZxoxYcKO_vHfJCAbGWJQ9oviqwt45_jR-5JPQY_fqZQ8W5qK4oYpEHeh1XAR3D4BHp0egb2AHBF1SEY56bzXZ_zemIworpidr5UMVEM6VMwbTBMx69vZu7dMBQFF-znDC9YfZuCwIB0HGOg-_fzh2R_QEiwQOX3ZEzUT79M9hvy1MKXTXrzBVmIXwCt49PsNYybQkB8693wJnopdbQQIJ840vy3Q31icOONIBl6EhnRtZUrvmDLl1bErnCgRUaXdQa0eO7L5QgDnVJS77crucsQHPqqu4m8xK-vpi04-VQ1gsaY6ScMOED_29f3Mc5NoQr-GKyKCLNONGC2yCi9Q7dQFqO6u6VVbQYe5MInho0DWCUv5gWaD-UsdXlEXvaNMjCjBI6jJOvbDk4Atn6zliURglG5IoXk0tvC7YUu-GghmC9DG_tx3k7kvCPGl4A3-biaGEQxksT92paXWFAHuowQ7_GUP5xD1WAv8H_91hZWua1ESzvNAy2YED-6uXqYsWGqkVlLkDg=w684-h387-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3QGa95jaO3GPmzdx80DGoNcO_UrMBeASrnphMpKW1Pk2jifhkGybZieKXAjstLQ9FY7dGbz0IRxFzSDT0FOr-4Tn_gPOMSlXIVzV3d6OghHfHG5g-Lv1gYuDWyeUr2HIU7JUuFP2Q15tke6MFxuFS2lBU0-zFm1_IpEagl8VDtR6I3i61qLY76WGFwiWxW8t3tkQSi4pDSWaWQWvrRz1TvejmGW1mBg96d3qoh_uoDj0zC0bQcYbN_4QxevHdQ-uku2KQfpJZTUh6ONK-yev3c6M18L_VEg89go5RAhBve-xUdx7_Gr5jiRKLpa2d4jrD_QCKWKJlY63jFRsgh3PNxaCfBW9JfLeLAHE89IillnnoaTIYv8VnAMIGmFUjUfTNkDZH_SxvCsWyhj9waQijn2KdSZeJ2dTvlhYMokmrAj3gIUiJoBs1MspQpL2Id2qi46RuGl4JNMi_fAATKNoh-e1t-ooiVgECGFXSVANRvEyH0CzcM-PjA-L0fdwdaNhy3wjWz6xZQ4r7iJ0yQzFlbrw9pYrsD7cck-Wtbbqi-M=w613-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U2PUWU94r2yAJhYvL4WtfG3maeypP0KeTX3swJjW9X_hwtxiNL49WxxW8vTusuzvRcC9ebfGdih6WTMTJPDNM9pCKDoNKL0C-lD1Pe_bGr8AJLRGdcgPzjHb9zgDiPMPauJu7Dj54U4ORMEdpG5XMWeFLNqXwtbceVAD3fSHf0T51Hgv4qNYb-6vDWNJ_XK7OTnzlH0oxfVFft3YlCugh_Hit51Dckt5ublC2ArO196pf7IzdWuf2J4l-OamT-uTUBwwwsTMOBXIjrZ19CutIifpt1Ud_8bhApN3gm6wprNSxmIqtHTZsY7RgTSUSOuRueojkGYRqdtZuJnFGPuXXQNW6XIT1HfvPtUhJ_oNwNTYczRjcnbLF9nxGX7su0FbdtYec98fNeAhgVSwgQQPrSWhLyr1FuA7Tqi_pgjTBkGgeQJh5E7JRGecDw8DWoOwngFXqXdij4yFNogUQeKuJ0Wg_qp7vKBByPlleq-smvHBMDOl9WOM58ucfREIKdtOUOYU_2BVqcUUqLUDHTbTwcwZWb6TFYGVEJTTqRavZhY=w857-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ipBaWIUt9sdZ7MnMRR3SWZkZ02g7P4OQtPMKlgUBeGHw03_xtvllW76VGEoFl6f5v3ECZnLMKbu3OyecnzFRe5rlOBe2USef484JUO0AAUBippu1EtrkgtJ3QzfD4mQpBE4Q1sCQoyUywjgPaJOkJm79fhg4jPFKxlv8mdXlhpA83ZZ4CGeZcogQiJvpcRwRMH0LWS9zkf48Q5rEoe8M-QVlB2xJYxCIP0wYkMYyarx1bL_yC3t9BgtOwWKrUqsaJ9tkdjpZrr1e7n0QXKN_mntRIoK4zSAaAZdJDvKBfJi0zMusy3TOIe6eTA4xMigZ9qenMZGcPiw5XA_5oUD2_B5B4L4x-u5Vg5iBor1qmk5n3_u1b8ZRNWwVeAIn0_o3uVcEWdBvN44GZb7GvVwwnuszxlvKg9Y4Q7BC25WSk8Phwfs_Zr7XuPBgNbvoh5dCI9WS87LwEkOqKROsadGedOJo7rBAK4G3idKVLRp-q-vbdwH2Mfvos7pod69acU8NOc2dqo8SSKVnd2QMMtbW_2K5op6rs0imH1EeZfX5YoQ=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G4GxEuPcTKcnM4rDFkTSzJDYtBcmijOAWA8USNg1Y58l7hQ2tYDPq9B6qTzwZBaMAiZKBTX_ghZ29PqPPrWWpCdg87UDDUUVNAd_rCNuH-SdFqxkucL6YJdO3XQK03f1oBF5sEDwF2idvfeiaYixq8oVJDlsBKXupNz8BBN8USqOS_r5XUfXGLt6Iods3ytvuw1tlCG7z46tlDRRKTTcSC3yRVnb7PB2FQw44w-C-r5f2md2x7-kcz8j3SdAYapY4imNPVZ6NSFhwORkA0ERFcYLwjhYiVE4DMK490jhUeiA-plCcJ3Jo8m47W-9E_FSWeRt8kK0gBpaY1-cEioE_DksGMU-tTakcQCfzvrZh8pxGwX6jnzL_OtOQcAEL3HPA51i19n23Vw1I1srX3djTYjFYr1OAdQYrLJDEdEALerzI3c_kQDQG2Dw3twioucFfIjG-0dkLVkV-S3IzNz1Gkudgxumxsn0dYkXqct6OVLz3hriLc3EEX-exo6bLGY9vFp7e5kTqD7yJHqmq9QigaIncl_Tx-5Ll_4fA9ifs4A=w278-h156-no'),
(18, 'Procyon', 11.46, 2.048, 'Canis Minor', '<p>Procyon (α CMi, α Canis Minoris, Alpha Canis Minoris; BrE /ˈproʊsi.ɒn/; PRO-see-on) is the brightest star in the constellation Canis Minor. To the naked eye, it appears to be a single star, the eighth brightest in the night sky with a visual apparent magnitude of 0.34. It is classified as a binary star system, consisting of a white main-sequence star of spectral type F5 IV–V, named Procyon A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DQZ, named Procyon B.</p>\r\n<p>Its name comes from the ancient Greek Προκύων (Prokyon), meaning "before the dog", since it precedes the "Dog Star" Sirius as it travels across the sky due to Earth''s rotation. (Although Procyon has a greater right ascension, it also has a more northerly declination, which means it will rise above the horizon earlier than Sirius from most northerly latitudes.) In Greek mythology, Procyon is associated with Maera, a hound belonging to Erigone, daughter of Icarius of Athens.These two dog stars are referred to in the most ancient literature and were venerated by the Babylonians and the Egyptians, In Babylonian mythology, Procyon was known as Nangar the Carpenter, an aspect of Marduk, involved in constructing and organising the celestial sky.\r\nThe constellations in Macedonian folklore represented agricultural items and animals, reflecting their village way of life. To them, Procyon and Sirius were Volci "the wolves", circling hungrily around Orion which depicted a plough with oxen.</p>\r\n<p>Rarer names are the Latin translation of Procyon, Antecanis, and the Arabic-derived names Al Shira and Elgomaisa. Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe used a variant of this, Algomeiza/Algomeyza. Al Shira derives from الشعرى الشامية aš-ši‘ra aš-šamiyah, "the Syrian sign" (the other sign being Sirius; "Syria" is supposedly a reference to its northern location relative to Sirius); Elgomaisa. derives from الغميصاء al-ghumaisa’ "the bleary-eyed (woman)", in contrast to العبور "the teary-eyed (woman)", which is Sirius. (See Gomeisa.) At the same time this name is synonymous with the Turkish name "Rumeysa", and it is commonly used a name in Turkey. The modern Arabic name for Procyon is غموص ghumūṣ. It is known as 南河三 (Mandarin nánhésān, the "Third Star in the South of the River") in Chinese, and it is part of the Vermilion Bird.</p>\r\n<p>The Hawaiians saw Procyon as part of an asterism Ke ka o Makali''i ("the canoe bailer of Makali''i") that helped them navigate at sea. Called Puana "blossom", it formed this asterism with Capella, Sirius, Castor and Pollux. In Tahitian lore, Procyon was one of the pillars propping up the sky, known as Anâ-tahu''a-vahine-o-toa-te-manava ("star-the-priestess-of-brave-heart"), the pillar for elocution. The Maori knew the star as Puangahori.</p>\r\n<p>Procyon appears on the flag of Brazil, symbolising the state of Amazonas. The Kalapalo people of Mato Grosso state in Brazil called Procyon and Canopus Kofongo "Duck", with Castor and Pollux representing his hands. The asterism''s appearance signified the coming of the rainy season and increase in food staple manioc, used at feasts to feed guests.</p>\r\n<p>Known as Sikuliarsiujuittuq to the Inuit, Procyon was quite significant in their astronomy and mythology. Its eponymous name means "the one who never goes onto the newly formed sea-ice", and refers to a man who stole food from his village''s hunters because he was too obese to hunt on ice. He was killed by the other hunters who convinced him to go on the sea ice. Procyon received this designation because it typically appears red (though sometimes slightly greenish) as it rises during the Arctic winter; this red color was associated with Sikuliarsiujuittuq''s bloody end.</p>\r\n<p>The reason for its brightness is not its intrinsic luminosity but its relative closeness to the Sun. As determined by the European Space Agency Hipparcos astrometry satellite, it lies at a distance of just 11.46 light-years (3.51 parsecs), and is therefore one of our nearest stellar neighbours. Its closest neighboring star is Luyten''s Star, about 1.12 ly (0.34 pc) away, and the latter would appear as a visual magnitude 2.7 star in the night sky of a hypothetical planet orbiting Procyon.</p>\r\n<p>Procyon is the eighth brightest star in the night sky, culminating at midnight on January 14. It forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle asterism, in combination with Sirius and Betelgeuse. The prime period for evening viewing of Procyon is in late winter.</p>\r\n<p>It has a color index is 0.42, and its hue has been described as having a faint yellow tinge to it.</p>\r\n<p>Procyon is a binary star system with a bright primary component, Procyon A, having an apparent magnitude of 0.34, and a faint companion, Procyon B, at magnitude 10.7. The pair orbit each other with a period of 40.82 years along an elliptical orbit with an eccentricity of 0.407. The plane of their orbit is inclined at an angle of 31.1° to the line of sight with the Earth. The average separation of the two components is 15.0 AUs, a little less than the distance between Uranus and the Sun, though the eccentric orbit carries them as close as 8.9 AUs and as far as 21.0 AU.</p>\r\n<p>The primary has a stellar classification of F5IV–V, indicating that it is a late-stage F-type main-sequence star. Procyon A is bright for its spectral class, suggesting that it is evolving into a subgiant that has nearly fused its core hydrogen into helium, after which it will expand as "burning" moves outside the core. As it continues to expand, the star will eventually swell to about 80 to 150 times its current diameter and become a red or orange color. This will probably happen within 10 to 100 million years.</p>\r\n<p>The effective temperature of the stellar atmosphere is an estimated 6,530 K, giving Procyon A a white hue. It is 1.5 times the solar mass (M<sub>☉</sub>), twice the solar radius (R<sub>☉</sub>), and has 6.9 times the Sun''s luminosity (L<sub>☉</sub>). Both the core and the envelope of this star are convective; the two regions being separated by a wide radiation zone.</p>\r\n<p>In late June 2004, Canada''s orbital MOST satellite telescope carried out a 32-day survey of Procyon A. The continuous optical monitoring was intended to confirm solar-like oscillations in its brightness observed from Earth and to permit asteroseismology. No oscillations were detected and the authors concluded that the theory of stellar oscillations may need to be reconsidered. However, others argued that the non-detection was consistent with published ground-based radial velocity observations of solar-like oscillations.</p>\r\n<p>Photometric measurements from the NASA Wide Field Infrared Explorer (WIRE) satellite from 1999 and 2000 showed evidence of granulation (convection near the surface of the star) and solar-like oscillations. Unlike the MOST result, the variation seen in the WIRE photometry was in agreement with radial velocity measurements from the ground.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dUvAh7dzIpAJZX_rNOQ8vXFOmk8Ds2yb-7T3Z3F4nO8HO94EnuPppm9o8GUZedEC5_Bh40NxcxY8XIpBZYwRxG5PYh2GzO6WVqbRkxL7ouIeDJrm9bKROqar6lkJc5QwQdTjlKSARTGUF-Qjc9BGeiE6zlaBR3qYDg_63ca22kpY9TrH8dqdMD12X0KEODfHrviQ9gYj1fCCxF6bgCJ9nB3DUDABaTp7HS3njVKWvYbIVHcQxwsQw2W9c8EoYtlJelMoZwC_uSTxTT5clWAg5lXjwPQTMbh_j3f1ColPi1Az_inFcRpKYXd8nRU6QK1HHY-nFB7GrzP0oEmtbhNvpdAyvNvAu5it3DzWhOzIgO1r1yWx26yhFQhG0AS2fxP9zsZcC0lNYKa0K_Go5uWg1wA28tBl6cNe4WlRLXKoHjMbOcz4lWjk8Krb-jcLfSul47XVoF19oRjxw3jDu_yvB5iDRTzdaWFjU62Duhpn3aZknFv79tARnwUKmahgI3JeHNYF21003mX7tPfhMImd71I2L645HASg_wSP_n5w6qs=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/m0955Uml2CzTCpt4WpX-lfBn0TqmUUeCDsfLJUTmmiy85FiY9qvxnGE9U0kaE_XaCt9BF_rV5RdAY0FvzC1D-Nt0pISN-7VJuROYq8mJZt-2l6bphTSu7H0dVC8V1RN59fkgvixfEq_yr4uzAso4CCwGgL0y06pV-cM5kUyQu8e9X89rgh1atPPSVopApvA1htHJE5uqRCyISNLJ9AOAy8hFPSpSEUePZSddq9J3OSu0eo68BsJ7ldOj_AD3vaN99m9LZFY91K_ITBfRyUj9i_hHMF8lXLddqbZZ2ZPEI5yQexbjhnMg4xmg9eD-D7iFn_B6R7aSFm1XK3Nxds2LteMVTBdhDD8ugCWT34GldT9J9PQs0kDUznAP9GdMJxzrKG2WHRSa8t1o0puqbA3AFE7xt7JpxQe_3T40PrVaz5XMOjJIuUdlqAVkMAADbpCLmQGWGxbgyXEivbLr4I3P_EmtZmxixkQHabsvc0V4lnSGj4rqVoV3Ys_uXhUx6iLeA8I3baSJYL7eeeEVxe-X33KhkJ8W9FLnIckQh9K2W8I=w300-h214-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cTxTB_uDlRST0dVoDXTS3LgDjsfKckCsHDLKnpXEowAoD6SwcMI45ozL4DYmE3VOy_DWdp6ifOBkCH48EzMCCFVSiJO3m3ienBNO5LKcehFmAthk_BAaq3mvIZoG03RsDsw04uNVkUZsGVyCWD8EnwLRaGmK8V1NS4xBktIyIOR8crt6DntHnf9Z42kfafcYW5bYVUeNNg57Dx2VFK2aw-tUesrv_Bswgo3Uf1SWvhqPzf_zrjgLAseGHFG2W3lE6wRC2VL3pm7gXDDfqct3FERtN_e6-Ks62b0Aa3qvotG1idndOpfXsO5tmgnBay2-YJFKmDg2gWTpe9vEklbt0G0dybhRxczN2T1USVD2b2MRmgAqI3VOCRCb_bKQO792qt_0jYSVsdHMOx0-3Gkx77jHBjBOXQ91s3YDHPf8ChQfDMLDK15z7mTViufgjHo-eB9zbmob5DH8t38lhrDrvB19JKAvAYMxqV_maDSAku4bL3abdTiuACxHR4n5xJLUpQWxGgVLWRXzC6R--Ut5hcuMJsyoWLIZbMUd9D6iNME=w250-h227-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U2PUWU94r2yAJhYvL4WtfG3maeypP0KeTX3swJjW9X_hwtxiNL49WxxW8vTusuzvRcC9ebfGdih6WTMTJPDNM9pCKDoNKL0C-lD1Pe_bGr8AJLRGdcgPzjHb9zgDiPMPauJu7Dj54U4ORMEdpG5XMWeFLNqXwtbceVAD3fSHf0T51Hgv4qNYb-6vDWNJ_XK7OTnzlH0oxfVFft3YlCugh_Hit51Dckt5ublC2ArO196pf7IzdWuf2J4l-OamT-uTUBwwwsTMOBXIjrZ19CutIifpt1Ud_8bhApN3gm6wprNSxmIqtHTZsY7RgTSUSOuRueojkGYRqdtZuJnFGPuXXQNW6XIT1HfvPtUhJ_oNwNTYczRjcnbLF9nxGX7su0FbdtYec98fNeAhgVSwgQQPrSWhLyr1FuA7Tqi_pgjTBkGgeQJh5E7JRGecDw8DWoOwngFXqXdij4yFNogUQeKuJ0Wg_qp7vKBByPlleq-smvHBMDOl9WOM58ucfREIKdtOUOYU_2BVqcUUqLUDHTbTwcwZWb6TFYGVEJTTqRavZhY=w857-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cPaU7r-DJItC79PdAQfhULUh8NSrRA38kUZz8m1V6cmNs4ScY8rdo4NJlQa3mTe2vXT8aNGdkISqWkYK7Jf2UpfdA9cNoUAAR_4nmT8UFPQWArlSzM3jDd8DPdjHDnakn1TQ-ULG1MgydATG65ZqPHYBM5vF9fFFjS6ynLV6hWMnfFA4PiwMIH15Pl0JFd3CSB_Jn3f4ln5F_dul24Jr9-oaObj029-B56xErMNJmfkfDzF-7Jm6lsbFR9XIW1J5nDGQdyRdn9_6vhVxTw6HD3YUaX4qaw5ArDDm37uWHjzKSiAqO0tlLv6Ufn-vkaIz23VS4oBn_XVtDGklqIKRJIEk1Mefi6YqQLKlswoXUFf4IOT3P6mUda65yBjh-Rhai0-Hs_3xB_iuhLfDYk-o9QWVlNM5i889m6RtzhP5o8Ni40FKz5YES1zQBbWD06Gry9fCJ7JIp4JrMyj-NwAuZAA3ozqSs5TYxjT_IUiZtJ-2YoU7z_VMOQJ0I5ibRHSzUl8CamFsjBFjUGwYpf-pj0P1WJixkM7ravuxzjFU3KY=w278-h156-no');

(19, 'Achernar', 139, 7.3114, 'Eridanus', '<p>Achernar (α Eri, α Eridani, Alpha Eridani), sometimes spelled Achenar, is the brightest star in the constellation Eridanus and the tenth-brightest star in the night sky. Of the ten apparent brightest stars in the nighttime sky, Achernar is the hottest and bluest in color, being of spectral type B. Lying at the southern tip of Eridanus, the star has an unusually rapid rotational velocity, causing it to become oblate in shape. Achernar is actually a binary star system, with the second star known as Achernar B. The second star is smaller and orbits Achernar A at a distance of roughly 12 astronomical units (AU). Achernar B is of spectral type A.</p>\r\n<p>Achernar is a bright, blue star with about seven times the mass of the Sun. As determined by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, it is approximately 139 light-years (43 pc) away. It is a main sequence star with a stellar classification of B6 Vep, but is about 3,150 times more luminous than the Sun. Achernar is in the deep southern sky and never rises above the horizon beyond 33°N, roughly the latitude of Dallas, Texas. Achernar is best seen from the southern hemisphere in November; it is circumpolar above (i.e. south of) 33°S, roughly the latitude of Santiago. On this latitude, e.g. the south coast of South Africa (Cape Town to Port Elizabeth) when in lower culmination it is barely visible to the naked eye as it is only 1 degree above the horizon, but still circumpolar. Further south, it is well visible at all times during night.</p>\r\n<p>Until about March 2000, Achernar and Fomalhaut were the two first-magnitude stars furthest in angular distance from any other first-magnitude star in the celestial sphere. Antares, in the constellation of Scorpius, is now the most isolated first-magnitude star, although Antares is located in a constellation with many bright second-magnitude stars, whereas the stars surrounding Achernar and Fomalhaut are considerably fainter.</p>\r\n<p>Infrared observations of the star using an adaptive optics system on the Very Large Telescope show that Achernar has a companion star in a close orbit. This appears to be an A-type star in the stellar classification range A0V–A3V, which suggests a stellar mass of about double the Sun''s mass. The separation of the two stars is roughly 12.3 AU and their orbital period is at least 14–15 years.</p>\r\n<p>As of 2003, Achernar is the least spherical star in the Milky Way studied to date. It spins so rapidly that it has assumed the shape of an oblate spheroid with an equatorial diameter 56% greater than its polar diameter. The polar axis is inclined about 65° to the line of sight from the Earth. Since it is actually a binary star, its highly distorted shape may cause non-negligible departures of the companion''s orbital trajectory with respect to a Keplerian ellipse. A similar situation occurs for the star Regulus.</p>\r\n<p>Because of the distorted shape of this star, there is a significant temperature variation by latitude. At the pole, the temperature may be above 20,000 K, while the equator is at or below 10,000 K. The average temperature of the star is about 15,000 K. The high polar temperatures are generating a fast polar wind that is ejecting matter from the star, creating a polar envelope of hot gas and plasma. The entire star is surrounded by an extended envelope that can be detected by its excess infrared emission. The presence of a circumstellar disk of ionized gas is a common feature of Be stars such as this.</p>\r\n<p>The name originally comes from the Arabic آخر النهر ākhir an-nahr, meaning, "The End of the River". However, it seems that this name originally referred to Theta Eridani instead, which now goes by the similar name Acamar, with the same etymology.</p>\r\n<p>Due to precession, Achernar lay much further south in ancient times than at present, being 7.5 degrees of the south pole around 3400 BCE (decl 82º40'')  and still lying at declination -76 by around 1500 BCE. Hence the Ancient Egyptians could not have known it. Even in 100 CE its declination was around -67, meaning Ptolemy could not possibly have seen it from Alexandria - whereas Acamar was visible as far north as Crete. So Ptolemy''s "end of the river" was certainly Acamar. Achernar was not visible from Alexandria until about 1600 CE.</p>\r\n<p>Achernar will continue to move north in the next few millennia, rising from Crete about 500 years hence before reaching its maximum northern declination between the 8th and 11th millennia, when it will be visible as far north as Germany and southern England.</p>\r\n<p>In Chinese, 水委 (Shuǐ Wěi), meaning Crooked Running Water, refers to an asterism consisting of Achernar, ζ Phoenicis and η Phoenicis.</p>\r\n<p>The indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria named it as Yerrerdetkurrk.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WfHqNmpSIGuDK4ir85Of0gxpttDwsQidK_zTC_2SCzEGn68k5iIk8O5UUA2sbCub1bxqhMgtqtEQkAnOOxPkctczcja4mSoZf8RyCrhKJkeKk_sSgBmabU6cWofhtnJ3fhXjzGqVLW1rYfAZHczAW15qI_ni2EwpnchwKSYb5zUrnZtGT_AfKizC3oLb9MusEfRBSeTfIBIEUkDk6SDFjz5KK-Zg8DmVolDivYOM19WDE7Qrbm9EhOlJWUt7BilNA1g_TDV3MUOJemKKKY9NqtttnqoKVHAms5OCku4jXZ0WhheKtZmmhVvovUXZJEM5GvT_x_9BBpU-qjl-MbXB_OjxTvtGH8vGo32RzctioesVqgMxgJAxOlsl7RxiZv9av_1rYejGmVWzj0pnYnUcwjt5VtLyK1eWtF9q90d1l6UZBsK-p5Hp09GE1i39ux0s6dklzlCxkRfwQeuQcz5M-r2BRb6V5jOrTc7gc8Sr6L6dCmSa-spjqtnuzGkRU9ykpOqtKyg8VFhn0EsKwUEdmWWxYox8CuhdEacV89r-W_s=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UZan2yctb3CySHmKZtZzvchm6rm9SigoO6bq3RADGQ6wdLQQ-jcn8A_31NZaIcS5VaaGmNmZDfLQxWiyF0uQax8i0fppvTSYRZnZrLTpx2piCk3MmULoRhjfHWaiUL0D-zsS_3x_wGzJz6X_Z0djckADYXreKd2dK47IKKNRMAD3PqiR1rOMA6W0OKdITANe-WRCYiGZf7lShhf1CzsC6J0FLwp6_LoKtnCrskZwyFCtXtcmwp9M9I2Ivc7tJo6KLbpZp5p39K0BKwLwVUvQhb7rq5GnAqqpuvt8z61wH9s9Zk0gmyAvpSzirWR24DiC8-JxPabXBAfpaxlXrJm-M4BvDgHMXsAB_eITSBjiuWbj4n2oPABt8x0aHW7vWGrUoJ29LuLK2xeGoSRJeipznCc3gC8eWsQi6FvBIraanBYgTNNMYmLxDI64Ud-lxE-u50-usWWAkyy2ApfGF4B7OXg8rL_eob0s05Zy_PW5Ciuff_cG71praPhQ1PAH_WGAGVKjF2oh--d1E2XseBN4POF2nEXHen_3RaY2RHUHOLg=w400-h225-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UZan2yctb3CySHmKZtZzvchm6rm9SigoO6bq3RADGQ6wdLQQ-jcn8A_31NZaIcS5VaaGmNmZDfLQxWiyF0uQax8i0fppvTSYRZnZrLTpx2piCk3MmULoRhjfHWaiUL0D-zsS_3x_wGzJz6X_Z0djckADYXreKd2dK47IKKNRMAD3PqiR1rOMA6W0OKdITANe-WRCYiGZf7lShhf1CzsC6J0FLwp6_LoKtnCrskZwyFCtXtcmwp9M9I2Ivc7tJo6KLbpZp5p39K0BKwLwVUvQhb7rq5GnAqqpuvt8z61wH9s9Zk0gmyAvpSzirWR24DiC8-JxPabXBAfpaxlXrJm-M4BvDgHMXsAB_eITSBjiuWbj4n2oPABt8x0aHW7vWGrUoJ29LuLK2xeGoSRJeipznCc3gC8eWsQi6FvBIraanBYgTNNMYmLxDI64Ud-lxE-u50-usWWAkyy2ApfGF4B7OXg8rL_eob0s05Zy_PW5Ciuff_cG71praPhQ1PAH_WGAGVKjF2oh--d1E2XseBN4POF2nEXHen_3RaY2RHUHOLg=w400-h225-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gUBkQUzHJ8Nrw-cUA4eLmaN-Mt3OqyqQSkd0cLDHQkjKZ1pGljW3sU4UNDe09_OXqmeuwobjYzYNLizdo9BYz86TWT2KkdzDyK-xjQa47RcGvEZVXIH8RqN99cNZERTCK1iSRaN9cz9BoVDu5OieZknhmK2_XjYyfCA_Fk1V3VxoNlUQ6CY0RxE7lSsE9Ziku0KisV7M7SPB3BybiOWQiLC-UXro4E1O_CesLGTNJwv7aupmHWJ-9uY0PNl3DG2akzPjCmAZDvkRou284F0LZ0lCaWyEcJhvLB5078NLzUnrwl3h9aB3GGxyoFpIt_iaz-7J8QvCh2cfplY_BzqhNRLpoTrXv1LNlJbnigEd4tVMfG_3Fnn7prWvM6lvAXQ0-vqPJh_PeB_jDK1jJL4NR2rwBV4OaDbU6QRSs61tgpfddkfQkkoSj2ZlvkQRLUvGF0OsU-oVByMcMXWUdIDjTT6Uv0SpnFhHNqfEsfwtaL-HBNIi7ggJdBzZqzKCLS1zdAws_d5-RpzA1UhYVcxOwbC1eqV0Y8XVpLPcLQvOGfw=s799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UZan2yctb3CySHmKZtZzvchm6rm9SigoO6bq3RADGQ6wdLQQ-jcn8A_31NZaIcS5VaaGmNmZDfLQxWiyF0uQax8i0fppvTSYRZnZrLTpx2piCk3MmULoRhjfHWaiUL0D-zsS_3x_wGzJz6X_Z0djckADYXreKd2dK47IKKNRMAD3PqiR1rOMA6W0OKdITANe-WRCYiGZf7lShhf1CzsC6J0FLwp6_LoKtnCrskZwyFCtXtcmwp9M9I2Ivc7tJo6KLbpZp5p39K0BKwLwVUvQhb7rq5GnAqqpuvt8z61wH9s9Zk0gmyAvpSzirWR24DiC8-JxPabXBAfpaxlXrJm-M4BvDgHMXsAB_eITSBjiuWbj4n2oPABt8x0aHW7vWGrUoJ29LuLK2xeGoSRJeipznCc3gC8eWsQi6FvBIraanBYgTNNMYmLxDI64Ud-lxE-u50-usWWAkyy2ApfGF4B7OXg8rL_eob0s05Zy_PW5Ciuff_cG71praPhQ1PAH_WGAGVKjF2oh--d1E2XseBN4POF2nEXHen_3RaY2RHUHOLg=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3wEjiVUyEQ0n4UZ3epEQCJOU8kLFXW_Usy95RBYMnXm6uFvolgV47rL6wk9hi8PaIN3H8UwHEPWCWsDq7MX4KwYmFuDzd1AvfzvpKUTDGk_yYVH7UeqXX6xcO_mg3F1cfnSn5q5nfKb4idxDcabQxy0enq7EHyd3IfEdE8QXrqT0CIHvp2JMn3PDCnh9B6NiroWKFvRsdmIM5aBrnyEyfLBVJOEppJwg8rr1Ekjef8dBArcErf9NelyJS-Kj1XzggG45YrFHooQIcOEidxfvzlcdXDbuxsrxKs2i7X0apjhKDg22SNPHbWT-M2SJ_JMXkBvY-MwQ4aG9Irb8JxEC6RBJxgHSaWQ9b4ZPlyxsbmyX0o7v-3xvPfFKpcvfptI0kSxUIOlollPLc-4JBKSc8MsyPtPMHXFLgGyxC_2s8AtFiXfMOyQTQHX9qfoel3yI5lA5bFCOxu8XM6Td6eVA68oXPV4UU3ppVRmva-VgE4qEwmwy9_CRo5bopfqEm-8sv_8Mfc6TonWfnPThUG902iWra-8guPPoH8hvAhpYDRw=w278-h156-no'),
(20, 'Altair', 16.73, 1.63, 'Aquila', '</p>Altair (α Aquilae, α Aql) is the brightest star in the constellation Aquila and the twelfth brightest star in the night sky. It is currently in the G-cloud. Altair is an A-type main sequence star with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.77 and is one of the vertices of the Summer Triangle (the other two vertices are marked by Deneb and Vega). It is 16.7 light-years (5.13 parsecs) from Earth and is one of the closest stars visible to the naked eye.</p>\r\n<p>Altair rotates rapidly, with a velocity at the equator of approximately 286 km/s. A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation. Other interferometric studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the infrared, have imaged and confirmed this phenomenon.</p>\r\n<p>Altair is located 16.7 light-years (5.13 parsecs) from Earth and is one of the closest stars visible to the naked eye. Along with Beta Aquilae and Gamma Aquilae, it forms the well-known line of stars sometimes referred to as the Family of Aquila or Shaft of Aquila.</p>\r\n<p>Altair is a type-A main sequence star with approximately 1.8 times the mass of the Sun and 11 times its luminosity. Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; it has a rotational period of approximately 9 hours. For comparison, the equator of the Sun requires a little more than 25 days for a complete rotation. This rapid rotation forces Altair to be oblate; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.</p>\r\n<p>Satellite measurements made in 1999 with the Wide Field Infrared Explorer showed that the brightness of Altair fluctuates slightly, varying by just a few thousandths of a magnitude with several different periods less than 2 hours. As a result, it was identified in 2005 as a Delta Scuti variable star. Its light curve can be approximated by adding together a number of sine waves, with periods that range between 0.8 and 1.5 hours.</p>\r\n<p>The angular diameter of Altair was measured interferometrically by R. Hanbury Brown and his co-workers at Narrabri Observatory in the 1960s. They found a diameter of 3 milliarcseconds. Although Hanbury Brown et al. realized that Altair would be rotationally flattened, they had insufficient data to experimentally observe its oblateness. Altair was later observed to be flattened by infrared interferometric measurements made by the Palomar Testbed Interferometer in 1999 and 2000. This work was published by G. T. van Belle, David R. Ciardi and their co-authors in 2001.</p>\r\n<p>Theory predicts that, owing to Altair''s rapid rotation, its surface gravity and effective temperature should be lower at the equator, making the equator less luminous than the poles. This phenomenon, known as gravity darkening or the von Zeipel effect, was confirmed for Altair by measurements made by the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer in 2001, and analyzed by Ohishi et al. (2004) and Peterson et al. (2006). Also, A. Domiciano de Souza et al. (2005) verified gravity darkening using the measurements made by the Palomar and Navy interferometers, together with new measurements made by the VINCI instrument at the VLTI.</p>\r\n<p>Altair is one of the few stars for which a direct image has been obtained. In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his coworkers produced an image of Altair''s surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the MIRC instrument on the CHARA array interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any main-sequence star, apart from the Sun, had been imaged. The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator.</p>\r\n<p>The name Altair has been used since medieval times. It is an abbreviation of the Arabic phrase النسر الطائر, an-nasr aṭ-ṭā’ir ("English: the flying eagle"). The term Al Nesr Al Tair appeared in Al Achsasi al Mouakket''s catalogue, which was translated into Latin as Vultur Volans. This name was applied by the Arabs to the asterism of α, β, and γ Aquilae and probably goes back to the ancient Babylonians and Sumerians, who called α Aquilae the eagle star. The spelling Atair has also been used. Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe depicted Altair and Vega as birds.</p>\r\n<p>The Koori people of Victoria also knew Altair as Bunjil, the wedge-tailed eagle, and β and γ Aquilae are his two wives the black swans. The people of the Murray River knew the star as Totyerguil. The Murray River was formed when Totyerguil the hunter speared Otjout, a giant Murray cod, who, when wounded, churned a channel across southern Australia before entering the sky as the constellation Delphinus.</p>\r\n<p>In Chinese, the asterism consisting of α, β, and γ Aquilae is known as hegu (河鼓; lit. "river drum"). Altair is thus known as hegu er (河鼓二; lit. "river drum two", meaning the "second star of the drum at the river").</p>\r\n<p>However, Altair is better known by its other names: qianniu xing (牵牛星) or niulang xing (牛郎星), translated as the cowherd star. These names are an allusion to a love story, The Weaver Girl and the Cowherd, in which Niulang (represented by Altair) and his two children (represented by β and γ Aquilae) are separated from respectively their wife and mother Zhinu (represented by Vega) by the Milky Way. They are only permitted to meet once a year, when magpies form a bridge to allow them to cross the Milky Way.</p>\r\n<p>The people of Micronesia called Altair as Mai-lapa, "big/old breadfruit", while the Māori people called this star as Poutu-te-rangi, "pillar of heaven".</p>\r\n<p>In Western astrology, the star Altair was ill-omened, portending danger from reptiles.</p>\r\n<p>Japan Airlines''s Starjet 777-200 JA8983 was named Altair.</p>\r\n<p>Altair Airlines was a regional airline that operated out of Philadelphia from 1966 to 1982.</p>\r\n<p>The NASA Constellation Program announced Altair as the name of the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) on December 13, 2007. The Russian-made Beriev Be-200 Altair seaplane is also named after the star.</p>\r\n<p>The Altair 8800 was one of the first microcomputers intended for home use.</p>\r\n<p>Altair is the name of three United States navy ships: USS Altair (AD-11), USS Altair (AK-257) and USNS Altair (T-AKR-291).</p>\r\n<p>Altair is the name of a 1919 poem by Karle Wilson Baker.</p>\r\n<p>Three of them walk together-<br />\r\nShe is the fairest of three;<br />\r\nAnd sweet as the heavenly weather<br />\r\nShe maketh the heart of me!"<br /></p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Z58_Zstx2ot02kUU6LOU-Jq7n5KKyvtiBMdk6Cx9qEZ048WVQxpC6gnlaUlLRgkhKEDyzYFIDoOpayekc2DCs3IUh4eK7yjmdm2aLiifT5dfDWo5ypc-GnKMwUPj9bfRCfhtL-7kY3xpOp_nCcOASwT-oMiJgZIyQXPgyRgmV8oo7g2sTAJA17LMKY0FCS2slA2Dr1kYGBpBuGwsEraAnYQAigyVnxoP5cvcjEpc7wNq99iZ6MZGGABHoNG5vh5KECbYkTJO2onGvn9neZX1c7wxOaC2Ujls_UwOXS0zIL-lqTw2W9hH7aCBxAC5fOcxKkaFbNaQSbZL5j3tQ3YUXRuAirPIzeOCVFgmBFWLoKGcxYdoLSgAbhjCS4dQaxHXcROXMtL-8M5iGjneuvgyC4CnORn4fYARDsNUH8NOxuDXX-zPwDPZBD392849bYLgQmzYJME6Gh19b5FsWCsb1dciVQAfdPmSoDaX-08TUic_NhMUa7_E0y_WQixEy3qhonK9i9CYHWXg-0cqRCG_AMvlNiBXqiU1AlFbylGXMXA=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oD8YsiNw8ioqksymjKjq0mb2XViO-HREoD25v2671Bly_CotWmhRZ6u9AdqbklZvfmo1nEOFNuyFdQgdb72n8vqEVCyDDpyLnKvPgKc0tQCD8PkobiP_t21SsivTOg6ItSwnNHMMDZ5kgobpagaxJ2tkSV1B_oQURtqY3lIQnOzEgozf2hprUX1c2VlV9K0eSY8ZvdfLKoYCrDCaDcUs4CpF9Gkmc4ydFmNkoAeFbgcCQ57JUORMauZhr8rx_ovgqF_trwJIdNv-7bTTjl2oRgIib6zbp-QhAGBFAWNKIGEOVMX7Q3UTPEROWt1Xf-MxOt7laSOuyJPQ8qblVShUcSNfILNaSKbQ0R5mg4dsbXlWql1K2eXkx04VV4M8Ad8s32IAXzVXzl0ov9xAv3QrZbEHZPq91F11bP4wZN5RZ_-YDJZjvQ3qMiVWxovs_hh80mMdiwRC--ROH2mfO0buMXA6MiMVHTdvZuR3Qwi3H79kvjOK3P3V4vIKAwLchs9MmilTbKIzJWl5XOs4yZdWiqdBqVIcNVU1lBZUuJ8JsQ0=w1024-h688-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-23AhX5csdZb0vFzycDGhA6njHXyrzU0-nUX7s2VOOnCubmqULYCh50gqCTzH7NtNI1uzoQ2NVI36jGDBmFl4FdKyVyki6pFL7EitwZ_pzZzc_gMhKumN3sgz6xAlhywFnDhnpSk134syduDuW4pPaNFKZ0eXAFTAhgogD3j6wq3u511Dj-TGcDHQIKYll08TeaUooioEAv4Tbqe_wqoza5YuBpaJ0snlYobh137CXPBdkPXgChSpf5ug7UeWOoF91NBMAM_ETTMBQxAQrqbVjxISj5G8M8vSNFO61onfkTkFQ00IdZ9eygHKxflaooFcDYqSIye4P-bp9Ax8sPSjtwIlWBw3o4B93WmrJ3sUyRNY4t55FIE8c5F6l3tZ0Ec7FEtcA3PRwtUIa30lo6JvkdZ-sDMCBWrfpYPTsVk84EsBNH5M7iqLvuyPNa0rJDcM0k0mCCVbBEQ5tc1N0J4AvbgiNKhnPpChJgQZo2uJ8G7HskvW-P834w5meljAvw6Ula1bc33jDMAWNftEvf8wr2AD3F_mwJsU89cyZWDFuM=w512-h511-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5E_yL3jgI15-Z-ZdUU5UXOiy6uw1eAqF3x1U4mJWFwQaHkWAK2Ev_iNUA6DEYwKKTFAN-E41pj37FduzJg8UsQLNfr8CeSzs1H39-sgxHyC6CUYaJjlmgBO759soQguIKbtMzTP2idAnuI-GS3q42CBXbbohep6Q0Qm_LCyqvkgIiyqdDW36-cRzt2fkjkjVIMOHaqUZH3JSz4hlr5OG2XCg_hOXloNlKEW6deIlqcxdK9QJi8DqFNESQUA0a4aBkkeAuf95FB9381FAcc3DvQ7ol8sG43kmHchLYohjEFw-QmeN1y8m8H4jCmpj7ZAKe9IvzspYuBXoXVY-ut4NPXzmO3zSXUuHbFBPHruSCf2ekHGboyA089UWfuouFIZEjLidhTKNaYgUTDgLtv1_aGyaD5EpQKFxxOONx3W4M6iwmPqgL7bl85JhrJzKfo4ESxDP131SeXFdnlUO4HMy_q7MIewNbjNffFH_DY1IoGeN7Pm7YCLXv9yMGeL2xmgUhOyA7bWTFrUi8UoHNkvRzbncToZfauh-EjUk0W-waFk=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vkEJmCIFw5yYhoXSdEthGqTofz-hJgInFYlisxSXlMQ9dhRE8z916rih75a2rIWdXdv9a3pa8L1ExcjwXSM9bSGDuurDDT4OkU2B1Y0iY8jRVq0G0YY9tH-f6nTWEuw7CFCOt67zSAnYJI0bSND1hiNQIP9IjzTA7IVXS0XzohkrrOFyO_K1zb3FVFEmGluS-GQa1kF_m-0rj0p8sYUg9Q_0oxCH_LTUMer-KwzMcW4FjAXA7bdG9pyzA-R10Igmumkv-nHR-2YmNrOhFoJ8SAY1Xsq1Isi0iz6TWPjfSZiagzsefPhYW4iz-Mrom1URHeLq27ZmSrEjjwD7I5rv2MLrO2mHjvO7ewLIA3vHaEk9cbpxWydupHLjGL0pFq6fdpTUsy2n932MhyVplcRkmNUVvG0YN2jwLfOqYfV7LH2iQ85dYkJPzEcaq9b0ourEBpUanIRAZagOzsf5HhtRGrdMJPJ-k7PQfiiUv-A-bOdlQsEFwt2S0_ayPTl7aRfv_VihhfNWdYmTLHvj5qpAenzr1zIcKtIONOuM0HTuy9U=w278-h156-no');

(1, 'Universe', 'The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. The Universe includes planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, the smallest subatomic particles, and all matter and energy. The majority of matter and energy is most likely in the form of dark matter and dark energy. The observable universe is about 28 billion parsecs (91 billion light-years) in diameter at the present time. The size of the whole Universe is not known and may be infinite. Observations and the development of physical theories have led to inferences about the composition and evolution of the Universe.\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout recorded history, cosmologies and cosmogonies, including scientific models, have been proposed to explain observations of the Universe. The earliest quantitative geocentric models were developed by ancient Greek philosophers and Indian philosophers. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led to Nicolaus Copernicus''s heliocentric model of the Solar System and Johannes Kepler''s improvement on that model with elliptical orbits, which was eventually explained by Isaac Newton''s theory of gravity. Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Solar System is located in a galaxy composed of billions of stars, the Milky Way. It was subsequently discovered that our galaxy is just one of many. Observations of the distribution of these galaxies and their spectral lines have led to many of the theories of modern physical cosmology. The discovery in the early 20th century that galaxies are systematically redshifted suggested that the Universe is expanding, and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation suggested that the Universe had a beginning. Finally, observations in the late 1990s indicated the rate of the expansion of the Universe is increasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model describing the development of the Universe. Space and time were created in the Big Bang, and these were imbued with a fixed amount of energy and matter; as space expands, the density of that matter and energy decreases. After the initial expansion, the Universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation first of subatomic particles and later of simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars. Assuming that the prevailing model is correct, the age of the Universe is measured to be 13.798±0.037 billion years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the Universe. Physicists and philosophers remain unsure about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang. Many refuse to speculate, doubting that any information from any such prior state could ever be accessible. There are various multiverse hypotheses, in which some physicists have suggested that the Universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.</p>', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_f5PkhepXlBO9KZYqDkZqkokDztK-2PKsVN1Q2By41yyBo1lRQwnDjX7DV8kvx9ovkPg12d3RQu_ioa5P32mhN61o6z_KQXX6_aPAa0hVXqeHJBrRvtbrf48y_wdxRY10pxwLd0o5au3s-9QzXwI8vUvp-aOO6C6RPLoC8t3ZPTLr26pSnKuuwe1lCB1wiHFyOKJd8BMqTPWPuouQnLIgiOqUvksnxd21th9OeAZDoMxNfkGHmLll6Swb82dby1QjWwUMxGp1mLkh1A5WHbO0Fdh2AesrSVDHktc0UlLLcn2X9qlExlhnKmIhCFeZJGYDOFyYQ-JM3ZtWXqnswvAeqz5wP2i_us_0jt-IEwhzUck5af9Yngw-IJsE86rx-_rZGuDfbvDW4ILHNx_iwRROIlO_mCEXB4Bh3H4IOQy7kcSk_aQihNVTBWPHAE2fBS3HnAQt7TYWd2P-Mj0oyEcfmfuplsEBRafyEs4i0HQFGO3eoCQTSfFKfxpAEKo6D7ZzUd5ec_kD4ij_ILOI-QRsrd1n6-Y7GWmY2l3EmKApEE=w1165-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xeeOYZi7x2uEFeV2LbVOJv3YeZIs5GrPIZV1PH1-r2NBwbWryHB05dzY_tGVl2CwGldAXL03AmuskVSv_Kv92FL8np3KB36al0QEul_rl_YLZ6mi5VcuCF78kfGoplpGEygD_rK6kRLoAvGEq7MvmBydhHc3lmhILQIccZqRfD2lZGVoTYMEpnNFPsIk1outnPHNOi2ArMscbuHAXq_CEeBoMoNWANcjkO18s4m6as_Wf-OE8aZ_vQ-Ljxk3tZydNT7_npMPe9O1DO7DQarZxUcouD4fB6n6TXr3x7WMogZ8TY3sIATX9ud1m6ksG9CqVj0hmjm3xzh81yP91hDmfvmMPMiw9k9xYnDGwcP8_dpIqgZo-6OkrC2cZgn2uPPttw0pVzIPhPyFuIZiCNXz-1gkZ2u3eKcz-t6mb6Q0h9fTYleQCXl0e9GkleSiKh3wJNc9c0eF-f4YEF67qadDyOI-UqXFVDhmY_EWmijM2X3UZ9xXmogIaVErQ37DIlboirOlaMDWg0I8AXptw9fTwtg4nPo7opPj9vNurKzzuMY=s799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/18SJnskM_Uh3-jUUTh3EHSeAbHeUrBOzx4GWydazakvgmzmr4g8WS6ivyAeO0DdDgAmZuoqNppxCxCLJFJxHQFj-jhbzBVazjyugjYTQq__Rj0tUZ4Yr6QysOBoJeQ9VYbPIQvflZAhChn6kvtZRVHEmMSrZEWjjl8zj4nQ__zGRZ55C17k0HnDENwIhXXyhB6pxZPKS2-0rwr__sYafsilVbnCgfhD9t820swV8wHTdAaYT84iCntVYPYBFFC8IZH1nnW2RNinfpJuG5rhin8Y57kWZduXBb19m5ymI50dTwtisuTvDi6FEvMdEhD_DjozvSN32SDxQjqaJfmA543DF1iOUgf7rlMpf1Ra-7AqC4YQyNvvFny0v-AMzKDNRbt5_ACuOTbzJfZnUm5qLsmDYNR138MSS_yusVBUCtLEeL-RdVDyZxI4C1EHLywBty_GxoBgbvS8dYOAo2RPSMG3GTq-73Cv0RDWIAnUPqvTVZcqX4FO6BLwgruEczyACnTYScHEB9nVfU6kqGcFN3YvD3V7KxSRaEcYY9PzzX8k=w640-h452-no');
