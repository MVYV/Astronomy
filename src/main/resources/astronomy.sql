(1, 'Mercury', 0, 2439.7, 'Mercury is the smallest and closest to the Sun of the eight planets in the Solar System, with an orbital period of about 88 Earth days. Seen from Earth, it appears to move around its orbit in about 116 days, which is much faster than any other planet in the Solar System. It has no known natural satellites. The planet is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger to the gods.\r\n\r\n<p>Because it has almost no atmosphere to retain heat, Mercury''s surface experiences the greatest temperature variation of the planets in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day at some equatorial regions. The poles are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). Mercury''s axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System''s planets (about 1⁄30 of a degree), but it has the largest orbital eccentricity. At aphelion, Mercury is about 1.5 times as far from the Sun as it is at perihelion. Mercury''s surface is heavily cratered and similar in appearance to the Moon, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercury is gravitationally locked and rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. As seen relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth''s orbit (as does Venus), it can appear in Earth''s sky in the morning or the evening, but not in the middle of the night. Also, like Venus and the Moon, it displays a complete range of phases as it moves around its orbit relative to Earth. Although Mercury can appear as a bright object when viewed from Earth, its proximity to the Sun makes it more difficult to see than Venus. Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in the 1970s; and MESSENGER, launched in 2004, orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years, before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet''s surface on April 30, 2015.</p>', 400, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KNioJy8TgM_vwbIBaJJpi1NpH7gt11CaiJjdE4b7tVdZXahsLFUdpBms8lglYjiSzZbY5aXEqA7HKqw0iFdqZ2nKkF_08vbr3_4cg8XEknZG4cG0IX4eL7qeHjcssM-Tp_tjgo3v-jUmXNZt5sVC8wXRWqLS1Rrrw3m-twDvbBC1HpsmIv3Z-3GLTpHEmNbyvyZUmL8ivSn_mqeVAqvn45y5-Al5JXF_VYXr17ZN-JP7saLl5owjFLxBRi7MweYt7vaUX5nYuKJbn3mEQkKfK3nYdMk04DgXgoLzMxEE3i3TL3KcJEP1QRqfAu5Aztsln05nfG-Zbmp0vtwFk1YtgGzaGhWkx0o8hR7K6umxgeDSM7JJH_z2w9ueg4ZRaqBBba7ieG6u4e2lgkRp4-Bf6nUOvocnJ5W9tYbz49ZRcVLtr-BLrcYsOnGr5jHXNUu6QfM8YSIQ2qNHtw4hHkRmmKZmDiAL_02hW2VHdbMHu9U8njPMSS4C2toFPkpp0amxUVB0tGM3bwjkR5mVRNHCleYqHlG4_9zlBomrQgpxceQ=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bNE83UX7rGlXEQFRTEt3XOdB_xrCGE6Mv3ES0pzNI1j-G9kasM0jcG2iWneAhEuLIU5R1pFgxQpfpykWpbT3O46NjgDhQeWS8M5GIHDrrX5SWGcVeriEaaqw_jr78XWcjSlWAoOzR4mLQs0Zk19LZHauip4zqh_E4ZPMix6m3XQtpw-YMKIsmRgp2Omdg3PcsH4o7JB680uPh763E_AFxOrePbzQnssKV2aP85pwh8olVf3OhjBSF0ahmcJUFjCw_pgCJ_c5K-YSvnonyI9jUA6YlVExX1PUSSfxIMwG_CwouKUpzN3fqVYsTal5WTteUCwquXiFlnQEDyPkYdkKnl4IGUEefymvhQuS4FvzAkQM_IEMi5udTsdpzeQ9LRmY7xj1QetIYTEjYG1ajHtgW4RIaLLLVAcdRt5SfMsAQuZ9A-07EhBlj6GhdzXJkKta2M05H0ZLRTUpAOzikA7QR0G4SPlMxnsoOzVhTgaE-o85wnCPLhCU1V4c6VSniyBAHdrHTNCDIKjtcJHRF_GVTqdi15p_LSafqzTWlt8lbeY=w600-h330-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QhSLTEnPmgr24coHyR9eGFPRjoKW63bNX1NJ9Ty63re8zho2ZMNWF4fd2D5VceiCQdQFFfYcv38HxRINzWYI7-T_RuALqhLF92OaouWQvQX06eg4d99NiRfHhgP7qpoPcq6J_q3Yz2YB13SPdsHfkMPjBwkVuECbZKEbO9hL3LPe7e7iTLKm9w-rB7HhovMb4rBXEQvEtMeAjcqZXh1muGjFhKyhHiSSnp70G2Awyb5QKGVY6MWumNYRGS5vmGprix0iFqC-XQY-kRiISxhsLFfYW1hBWim1nNCS417QaRc9hbUt3CoTiDTroMbqhnV8PAyEsGlwKMHc_Uc5QGcn1vVuNvUAeznwBNyLtlK8_5UZZBZMVsk9KBh1dd4zm17LshLRc9S67gNN24LGDAztZLtAAWwERanscf3CAijpCg270JSl9oM0dp0l1xQTB8uSQCAXZ-aOQlgFrLM6kKExaCJ9MG4qP2VyfV1Jm02RfKqHoIAp_H4J1Fmg37vz6aYNsAB_udzx6Hd4MI54PtM8eqSMu0Gd9U_l9nTd56EvWtM=w1024-h778-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Et35lG5QkGCCeGUKGY2r_VLaLL6eYhor-6xUVsAbvk-1IfawDrnifWVVmLo4V5dXgWYbDogiN3-vPWFx0pJTdnSzWhbxFRkYxC1UdmC5fKWzNJVIuZUdhILGR4GH6O8xoTn7Hcny5dGeEKpD_zR8PxeG2W1xXeVxo_HH9-5csYwsJx-zN495yI6JZN_r36-yIos35vBJPtT-Pl45m-1ZBDip3cj408DPEy9sPTbwB7uZkCiyMbJwf2vKDmJ9GoIW4rAiHQrZzTMYDrqzxb05ZSMREO1j4i71nUqpfz78Ddf_4dTIw3526cxx1HgfD8FYZw3HZQiGMwskglu6u5r2S-5OBIMnEo-IlASBl8lgbaNQ6MUAGqQh9VbXZjHH4wJKJJ2ThfNl74Zh1anny9_VILirEjkcNtdZ7uGfkPFTkJ6h-VgiUz4NIWFZR-X8sIKuhZhiu4nwc7qbA8PIPybYiQGJqt_v0qH_DrETAlVUCCIxe-XI6aRhU5zScCxeepipYMhr8XX5hQNnOcHN6OQ_c-SxfQbvqUZ6PTPq4TXYCfw=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OpJi74eTx1iDGEWtZVrpeeWTT4WwFsm8aNYPmMfhVxFF-OU1feNS3TarhV_R106zbUJjN01h3DXR3JnO3cgM-ft9vPcCo9Fcw6oIxQnixNh7bvadT7mjvWUkfIdBBMlPiZPOiRrr1HEY5Bfm7nsLJbpcZnEGLuwtkSDDf-QVygnwfDSZ0VnuVe-tsgYF7pry3FX-JChT9vB-A93Ej_74ZnEScwaNjnJAwIYyeACYhKCwYjwYMeKcW5RohsX1QOynodcuM4Xut283Zby8njMINxZ6MdOp9hVkasBdDNd1R48w9s905jkvUuLIKtFCKqRPv_vYf5CSLAQNCxV4yCGLmABfNyTYo4PqR9HVO6sUXyp1ZlIPbKgRDsHdwTL3mZvn5jz1IGtctnTC5VximAN2GORIC7tgYsD2_0DM8zaKaOiemhzWPMvocTYUMkkmtRIWFx-Tft71fRchs3h92mt1qerhGcGm45KMu3jc2xnEp1xB5WcEjVcbZi91XGf1i-iaplNxSdOCVxzPBY6hwjXXF_ZZSaxhq7Y4sXQ4LdTM7DY=w278-h156-no'),
(2, 'Venus', 0, 6051.8, 'Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has no natural satellite. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object in the night sky, reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6, bright enough to cast shadows. Because Venus is an inferior planet from Earth, it never appears to venture far from the Sun: its elongation reaches a maximum of 47.8°.\r\n\r\n<p>Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth''s "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet''s surface is 92 times that of Earth''s. With a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F), Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus has no carbon cycle that puts carbon into rock, nor does it seem to have any organic life to absorb carbon in biomass. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have had oceans in the past, but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect. The water has most probably photodissociated, and, because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field, the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind. Venus''s surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like rocks and periodically refreshed by volcanism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, meaning that, like Earth, it is a rocky body. In size and mass, it is similar to Earth, and is often described as Earth''s "sister" or "twin". The diameter of Venus is 12,092 km (only 650 km less than Earth''s) and its mass is 81.5% of Earth''s. Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because of its dense carbon dioxide atmosphere. The mass of the atmosphere of Venus is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.</p>', 737, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VlYCGHTBIM0Zu736a_b9zsZcACuYkQCh0I9zpXiktay2Z-unnbZZLiUenJm5C6UNRwnGIKkNFDn0ASZEEE2AwNUfggcI6SVx6NtdSi6fQ3b6PYzlL2IHRksz8-LkWGyzPvrZViXbJ7TXHEzQVKVEz1mbM-eg_TwA3dKCPuQoBKFUIhhO6M2w48DZmGgTwnulpVOaijtHPrzBh4Nm3zc-C0i878sSva9sMqJ_6qidvB0WdVDaKYcZexKUtzLSWDU7EnBRVUE30uPeHl8Pu9rT8npZ9L7Uv442H3NNQPA0eQ3u7vrkwXg-mQiAbaEYkzKXztUWqoxX7ySsEewcS7-hMwxD0YPt2HpgwBjPyrT3LMqyUQneLUeWALzm0cqtEEqUZp9BCFzGLrdWkhuzgqNZxf6wkuEND1Au8wK4jaUQZwQ7v2iwwHliuEpL22NZCqQkK43w4KG-t--cuDPvabelYexxffw6mXEhmzYoJfEiow5N6NJq7oUmAVvjku7eaWHzmSKfMeiLSq4-WE9CI8YRNqXwo1tvXWYSm460Zz6c4bE=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/swZ40uY8YAPQi1OwsC_sd2MQy3HMFvX44OLkx5HwBTVhfJjvGUBAhJrO7BuGvEqvW8jDy1JIJyFOgvbXnIpehZ1efqydi3Xgwx4_ozS1qYE9c9tz2MRlctLVgoKwwVQ9Lx-gVYr_xlo0TdQUFRffYJPBDHRi819XrmH8g3psNUpXejxCiBIxPj2f2kdVQPmbIr7JIyytA1UTuLRdf66KnQTLZKffXYqRqCEAQxTBVVpuwmnuULSGEZSNkM9c952DDWY_oVWzv3JZ6PjNHmlO4MVQfvoafcf3WZBKwJGd7sb8A6s61l2v8hM783mWouxyzK-qFC8FuP0IAVKASXHHgMLn8-dhbeWV46It2NLkd4zL9RKBleRJPlqXBLHLz5iVPBtMj7yQEQlUlo-s263Ytn4QjkOop_3gh8p8w2h9HHNa2tHmRSkFQia6onVbpmIobt3IrRRBp0gyllqLjb397U4rbEM1b2rzMuvZa5Kg8FaP5zQdf7UCtfF6Fm7viXccivGeznIy9NXRQ1uyijXcyJBGXvBCXifdhBlV6HDgJwU=w1496-h650-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/429_ZNzOZom_8ijHGb6kvXRCLXLSOD4HHAB2yUj4OGIjEgDe5pli1pSrZR9n9SfklgkrlrGtGNF3oMNDdsPc3bylDkef3jSozueF2W7AlG6csa3dYw0PPstXRxZ2Dx45ZIZDA9mMuYiguYu9Ux_a3QE9rHhTnQtKTqXHmSSJea7uPTrKiBSIBaXwehpA3if_JzYCk8Qcc1pnKmGSG5_qJ7jDTcoPB8ZIc11x3zOkyTYc25XVVRY2InFAQlEY8JLpIO741d9rcdDjIr8BXwPg9ktivoPlVGvDxwJdASXa6YGdGvCQ1mhTyuDVn6yCOCIo6WE9BoCi3xsd7-xLBjI6BWIRMyVPTPOArs-yTaqTxZlEctKk1rOT_9QfPwDaG7jHKxCvfHwEK0iV5z4UlAUgxGh1XXu_mcteZRJAOnkYpGBcuzyDWDkejgfsNSljfuh5XKsDAu0rqs6g7V-Sv71-CIRC-6_d-5lwu8Bo7N-kAJXKG_776OOSAszB0C4RWAnGDpa-1PttjK0SxsCXDEiBJbqXM45hlDkgX5duKZ-zM8k=w640-h320-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/L6zLQWl-5cPN3ciHetA3pgN9T9rfxixUI7PgJqnNjAeaZvw1FtKUlX2Yqjxx0FCUOjwpHossIT2iw9qqCTkgjPo3tA9T6Av0HpoSOnleQkZWBevm9TJmpTCS8N_6knAiwF6DKE6RlKJb0rtt3CRBvRp6sBC-QR-kGwEnnVjB0fE3o4SmSXg8sy6bqq68h-AfA2LzmYwHDdVtQrobzZ5IDk9b7n6YAWR8IqjvufMvMJLKu--P-LulhSlQTLLYjzHQ5bjLMDPtHTDZwgomNkt408d9SOb9XaGWgSww3EY7DQ8VRBrmR5ci4M-l1utvtof7DFRsqK2pSK1uwkxEFGKT8zWxsTBQHzZ2NR-ZCHOslU67F1fUFty9DjZeSMXTwmVkdz2CZZ7pEK2a5Q8_1Ddir6EBewMJUpCDbl6iCXYPIFRzeVPTvYe5tOg5GY895juNKNBBY1LrtOrv_nof3HfcbMQ8VhaX2VlMs4Wk551ejjHJ3DOJr44YA0JDCD1YT7chy4jR-enoCydjp4ciwMJaRFOr4StFFbwW_qqUf37m714=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p6ylzEPlOnKf6t8Os3v42PkG1FqxoRdQjxp5KegkZaXkM8dWBR3ubkwt7C3H-dCu8T9s7gT4BJBM7gn1iF1osGYPImSrbkeQpLZWiTnYCQM7GyGVmA8OdnVJTKAPJpsbYUzess0OBGQt9wSCshkpgQUllYzyzhfeFdeplDlmUx2LB-aQMB4A8nkB-x4zhl0fvJtI1-TzGMbDmpgTi9v3IVoxOr6fVvc0DHByq3Opvl62_uCQF7w3hRMq387kvjca3J-dDka8SVLxkT-F7rTpxORWMoa72paNlEMaHpJ5kW3AWqaKjWvEagpcVc0UgvJDe-wcN_hm2DHaf8bELSoVCr2s6DtiqnlG683BhdtDBhWvdIJTnviPxYsIKxPVKnhcx-S26g6WAUJQxKs02wiUJXDy3TwWHejivFDMOfb1KDXt-9cqTauuhmSfQKBi_EcJV4KIFwC7kx2lrqidEfKkDLeTc9yPdj65QZFaj8um4-rwEguraGYtoVp_lyUOCqGIAnYvchc09HDCiM60F3nHKtUah0NBWajdOYF0FvJLBhg=w278-h156-no'),
(3, 'Earth', 1, 6371, 'Earth, also called the world and, less frequently, Gaia (and Terra in some works of science fiction) is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System''s four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to accommodate life. The earliest life on Earth arose at least 3.5 billion years ago. Earth''s biodiversity has expanded continually except when interrupted by mass extinctions. Although scholars estimate that over 99 percent of all species of life (over five billion) that ever lived on Earth are extinct, there are still an estimated 10–14 million extant species, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described. Over 7.3 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and minerals for their survival. Earth''s human population is divided among about two hundred sovereign states which interact through diplomacy, conflict, travel, trade and communication media.\r\n\r\n<p>According to evidence from radiometric dating and other sources, Earth was formed about 4.54 billion years ago. Within its first billion years, life appeared in its oceans and began to affect its atmosphere and surface, promoting the proliferation of aerobic as well as anaerobic organisms and causing the formation of the atmosphere''s ozone layer. This layer and the geomagnetic field blocked the most life-threatening parts of the Sun''s radiation, so life was able to flourish on land as well as in water. Since then, the combination of Earth''s distance from the Sun, its physical properties and its geological history have allowed life to thrive and evolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earth''s lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. Seventy-one percent of Earth''s surface is covered with water, with the remainder consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. Earth''s polar regions are mostly covered with ice that includes the solid ice of the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the polar ice packs. Earth''s interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the magnetic field, and a thick layer of relatively solid mantle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon. During one orbit around the Sun, Earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times, creating 365.26 solar days or one sidereal year. Earth''s axis of rotation is tilted 23.4° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane, producing seasonal variations on the planet''s surface with a period of one tropical year (365.24 solar days). The Moon is Earth''s only natural satellite. It began orbiting Earth about 4.53 billion years ago. The Moon''s gravitational interaction with Earth stimulates ocean tides, stabilizes the axial tilt and gradually slows the planet''s rotation.</p>', 288, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Kf_IVAMK8iL4glYmvdM4XvVEQrMciLDuoYhYWzRNtcqFpsDUw0IFLJtiwdXiSwUAgiRBNrmQnM6PasByexPi-gYsOhVflC9ekxqS3nB4slUAxMswb1bCqMtG30qXuWJ7DhVRHud4zYVgAq-w0Hy-h6GNpJ0x7F1A6l9RmyW5QXpIydB5vNaVjJwTzmYuLi35ofKIifx-hj0OWt_4L2v3Grh_w6SiGSm-t4Do80effINLoUzKsnY6DMBLl26MJMRuMel35EiFhWt4HBjVmaygTxnTNTzaozUkf-Ex23iZmMaRTPkK1jTjoFvV3kOJC73borlr99SfKz6Jg0gTtAC7UhZXiz1W2gonMTHfJzrE8V66wMnQ0JHsiJGR7OixPhzHYYWuvbj0dZnZr0TFuM4czqJH1QQYWT-2vZrkba5dYqsEsVTVOJPUfvdwDFiBW4I3qfzRfn8qs8yFpor7IXx_dAEkmHfFhBl61Dx-sHs_EbJzDyiT2YjloQ4tfwD-1Um5DWhyF9VhLPA2oK-O5sYkcm2VxxaRm7YHdFexdWTVWgk=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8RnSU7_AawVDZjfH39F1Z3-aHo8kL2MkYZdHkS_7OEjDQl4ghBc7rQVTjo4Vt702UzYeNGChe3pE7xuyofRFk4E4PJSqldB2ZrshFIrpuOAPADhVdXSIKTz02m3ueY_EGI-iiqNKRScMxXfKFK8xtgrbPJcwiaF4X93eZJuTDxi_x2S5Q0p6LUU5xTQAqF1vSECaPHDh7zs2s9GuIUqHVrtKZh9n7dteHVyOh0BFrA5dgpJszCVp781_P7JyCPXwXoDEKFzSSOEMcDj5lI0TIiD9bFn8RVTeSXYDXsmFrJFDK4WQDGAA7usw_xRoS_jncChoEvlACur29ZyhYPiJJLku4D7xvsCpcJZmZ2KoWxqnmupRsGVLgFc50Jge7xVXkvX2NrJJxJrjMCIZLdfc-JfNW9nbQ-oBF3uWqEU49jmYOrVyRBclbP6OeYSz6yZVatqO1QZ-KKjyEbRrAwcR5SuVkeWQRUOChBv54XgFIBpQKFERd_dD5YjTN5O_Skc9LY__VR50KdZ71XZyqwxpa7yUF3KXwL55erAatO7hVyY=w1421-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mqvsYcucKM8xcbwzcyA3fDr3WpUeakGzrECCtrZ-v8N5YdcMliHFuFkeZos3J_DgDoSnDHGw2VDXk1sB65EqsCCXPh9Q-J2xAwno6Ze4zhffk9ILMs_rdgOoObO1H2yoihpx4bO-JpxlKRoQwwOXCUNbcMs-30E-anwPS-k_6hl0YWoHQmRu4qpr_AYb4XllUu8ZumdebEA6Wgu6MmmEQgIUHgmg2FeYByeAU6G6NaoRYW60rFw4qWo6oJahAwycStrlK2Ky5zG5AWBucBhyO6DhvtP1JZKSprQHWxumAlj4t0tDrpqkX1OzIT7ZUiSIL8hbESMXY7KsasKMGJWRS4Iq74UxAzE7eXQAmNdD14gfbgfHiH4-am3EiDwIBuC2a5SITHEekci4g2QCg_vpdW6WTYGny7p3goDXccdmV4PSRDbZt9GoA5LMKM7tC9KnI-YZNWI3NeGvCD5VcVCKY575UEITTjHC05-8RC_pNhGMFBHKUnL3d_I-sbdxUwPETfyEC4hbPd3-6NfbOU-ddqaY9JH0ZdmsqhCz3gFG9KE=w807-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uxQk9zShMlnd5zTecq6eagRBhRMk7eLchWIo1Y-iyi_cxgJV0mjpc5xIx652cYo02NHDSx8jy9K75ElLPE8JT2GMfPKkah0df6jhW4_npX9mqhyBhyaWJLr7voquP7RTxKi9KtoZvoxob3F9Q1mBFT2BY--7jNd0eX5uAebOIXMa5ISlvuOQG38KKLdYarBOy56ytUUzVLtSHjkCpsRPgsCfBO0BcrIGestJeYVSCQQ3iOTh6s80RJZHGvMXJd14_W9sg73XpVclCT2QOCON_ItB_EjlbSBkJbluGduwY-loQLdnAkaZ8LKwIsCMRC9hfF1PkBpkAW-54bU4tOnVmUrqPZpKaG5N5pKgNk4DucbEPlAS_8MaZ74k57VaPve59E39IKxgFOVAvM758lrex03oiAq3zQfeIWMrufdqSSLTDlgpGvApK4gpFP-3sWo2ZWqD6dhFc3FqiK4fpf9LwOpgNjZ_deH06h9GVPZUQodfEd3AtKaXJO8A9xDZziKnLblifB7CtMUN1S2WDQJ6ViCCIlivLPQ_PtWZMvDG4jc=w1199-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/88TsHEQobPwe9W9FwK8OjLzVyn1XDlbAMH0wi9T7R6fPIKVPkGtWMZm5ZNRJWe-AOkeZwsG3SXJixXjC3p-6PAEFzFDvLiMcmAXKNltEPky62PqdmCLqprIQbue7FpvOhwDn9JGywIXBvdh-QS3GGw4QHPimQ3_4tB1MgyCrYTKin5guEQN-k6SB3eZeS4XoLmXo0_tf2XTERickajnGInoBkf2wa2Zw4Ln712YnCMdEIwGEl8basKDLZGCunix9DPjrF88nnpGg8UEABzHnhfkc8li_7ca4RYhS8J9yhOP43xhYZNXO-OjW3JwI11zlFTG1ps2Cc53ANlQ2lKAYFIf5mrkvOrJKSIvbpTLz6oiqrPGf-sh0ApMWtAiszpMTQjUi1W4vrzhfkyjpwkRyczdwh6dgQAWxeTqFmDDP-eDBHqUTNXweuqhz10Rg1eRRaO2_kRFNP8LaOA5Bq_suYrKRbeA7G57Ol1hmsv2XmatkE_hiDosEeN6cJfKiz47cek4dZA3Va18G3Ea5Kpjo5O5DhsYdzK5ixY3i-LUrUGY=w1421-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cAoFNKE7LsVRC84dXyopwNb2XezVXNLj1hMMQ3ZrbgchaPTTU4dpNVDLKwZxFibAL_SzShILX-uJvEDLECDVQNwQ2KHFQxmLlbyNYvY_t4zzp51clrEMfxFAROWjyEweRgoEl-Y2oWk7q_tHlsMt36JA85yRSOSSBdRvqDML-VC_47f6nABgl_6Vm_36KmX6tKJlmapIb00id_4a5tVWJzOP8pvStXRNbO7uGDuz54S2zOxzQsvgALV22dxAIsytZe0Nwk8wQ6gWykqRhQLIjnCYW6ZwKl3jvKKeag1QR6X_PSITDWckumzvYGaYOtr8Ic34p91ZsSf12ZxIrQ-T2xHjc2mIf4FOWBKzR2cbj6wQYnI5YF9nRk0CF0ItdAoBLddwmGrLqlNygXui06wYVPVJddow5pXC8nKqSLHju9MqBh1I6UjTu10-R1wJn0Uma_2WuCf6E3Tl3l2BW44Uyk5iixYLNfVtS8RO3hLVoLr9s7xcYgHBPl02XduYkI7g0fUP0IrZT8H_nQVddm3d3zZiOs2xTF6a3rd8kSMwafI=w278-h156-no'),
(4, 'Mars', 2, 3389.5, 'Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.\r\n\r\n<p>Until the first successful Mars flyby in 1965 by Mariner 4, many speculated about the presence of liquid water on the planet''s surface. This was based on observed periodic variations in light and dark patches, particularly in the polar latitudes, which appeared to be seas and continents; long, dark striations were interpreted by some as irrigation channels for liquid water. These straight line features were later explained as optical illusions, though geological evidence gathered by unmanned missions suggests that Mars once had large-scale water coverage on its surface at some earlier stage of its life. In 2005, radar data revealed the presence of large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes. The Mars rover Spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in March 2007. The Phoenix lander directly sampled water ice in shallow Martian soil on July 31, 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mars is host to seven functioning spacecraft: five in orbit—2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN and Mars Orbiter Mission—and two on the surface—Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity and the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity. Defunct spacecraft on the surface include MER-A Spirit and several other inert landers and rovers such as the Phoenix lander, which completed its mission in 2008. Observations by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have revealed possible flowing water during the warmest months on Mars. In 2013, NASA''s Curiosity rover discovered that Mars''s soil contains between 1.5% and 3% water by mass (about two pints of water per cubic foot or 33 liters per cubic meter, albeit attached to other compounds and thus not freely accessible).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitude reaches −2.91, which is surpassed only by Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, and the Sun. Optical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about 300 kilometers (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth''s atmosphere.</p>', 210, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dJTsK1WHO9gy7YsrQOwiVBd02an3AWlEgaC5T6fuxYc4sow9nWVOmnT1eF3k6NljPvyF8y5-N4Lq_o-ptKoEBWJ8FV92oukXykwsRvO39SVN2aAEa7SR1LwtOTe9Q91Pw16F8Qim1Vxe7mZa-aQhXkspETkY7-JaKAgOZZCvsIassuhZY95KGfiPLrQ9uATyoa_qqKaLG8RKIL6yGvhCrZC_zi6CS0ZZJDmeYSDG_pGhzS4Xg2kArfdtuQPYIA6ek4sDAJwKWh_AkdMfJMdtxVITti_xf7M1JN16sb0lAkJpn299cs8BgAgmaNJKlrccDULVL_jj-cUJoQZJWT8wgl1Oyvbwnucfl11CGPD1KqSt1C2zMiN_kHlFSSLCG4a-_qDKMLF2bdIJTUazJU8EhnXhMQ0ZxokgKsP5I6ilnIMrUbfld6qSqIj8KYpp4d6z1ra5OqEWEDzAHZ3s7ksJ2kCeW8WQ2_t2zcb7i3ggi15TkcNWGm_GQR0bPzskhgKG3sWZpXcVAIvIDlEtDiAEk80ja1WvSs5kZq0pjS2Sk5Y=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A1j8K5wZWP6gy4UQeLWVPFlpTQwjD-H1LlhnPQj8nraNT0MJgPx3ybgYO9AiIxC6U4XVz4v3CnwFgn0pxkIP6W-xleDxpqumBOBeWH6NdxUCofaYRYhD88LO0_hfzZJCgc8rPK713y8K8V7lYHOMV4aGC5-lkmnktAw_ygM2qQZgQL4npZRTQ51R-pwUUGXxPA2Wauy7dQMwG-mmbILGr4x0TuEekk68P47VMo4n2_MnLvJ6q-LXkt45vdEBZqsiSRX7OzQQWM0YaKqvEIJO0ZzQ4nALzwZK65ZVXPDEz7KvJGu7xoZd17w5Azsfdr4VyCjpeqiFINOkrPnZNp-S4_Yx2LwoV2MQthV-kBYFYBL6GAaczaJ6zApKXtK3Nht4k233yAhFhiMNFDW1Jl-ALXmNReJhMffjYDX3_niJfRzjjqVo6nwer5fy9z4G1NBd-iMpgdNpfgmSLoGFXaWcSzZTC3UKechHsScsBe3julcxGOmWBCGHl5M7F4XZ7sI3LyhJyyR-VHE4Pn_2HRI0h7-CbZrQfM_FWt6zuEjONKY=w1024-h576-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BYwHKc4JOiR9AWb_n6X8JISEc8KJjCLKUo7CZoVEwI_Y6KWiO-Vzd0gSJwcnYjvG5ELsUpz6BESCWpxYppkLmr7DQqHZv2mo673vRPCmDvWNZhvzNL6jvndr5s-0bFa5-1QuTyOorz_2ZfN3aai_boaH8SYc602qkV0iy3xEE0AFyNCYTx3sVOgiQvpvdjowZG2lcNGN92LE-z7DpK-OfF8XIvs4qnY3eXVH5j_knMpOqLh2AC-Tk38biR5UHnx7ajNeON4pcchZcWnMTq5iXmFxiemuWyLLjGEAm4uOjdwterCrW3VFzuxXKfU3lOHcupIES8EPQ50EIcGgxQNcXZPgpRzYr4VWlaLFY3cFT_z_LYNzrzZiF6Tjm3g_DaSdBLfeYilsZaRS8uLV4aXzto8g5BSZUsZhF8-o9TyNS6APqfjLWqfY1SulrAz4jEack_igyKaKj9RCPR6CS_C1RKfZAMs03suB435vdAG_grAXiUEPmLiOpqslIsKHrzWfBGr_1Jx_oDOkXHVIkl2_G0s8nvcs-z4eHDx0zIsCiy8=w640-h400-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FaYdVUt4G58kUYosb6mxllEd1AkYCSWP0Stc0fmZ74e05ThMj1vGGZGL22NmoQNDZTeQOu7Vo2l1EP1SGIv67_seb_wid6kp_cFuqpJrdJyiXCR5VJUqy-x1CUhtIeBg1YdnXtHnO2HuiBzh36ibNPf4jD4iw0Atxi35JipZM2yTj1No2EmjvDLVJTOySTQgU5mZkjeVsx_Dcwrk-jEV6h0e2osSTUIfqi5WYCSxOrF9t_YIg2Rl0a2eSwXHA2Lasg7nZovbafsJOLxFv0iEofEp7Fu1jlPc_TzGLF2TotuOOUfxYkJZa0_db1Vt_SRLJxfBX1TwDS5wj1O0Yypwh5r2XTWzFhsQaOffnUsCpAhCxSYviIBQ0NI6TILKW87Wrl67Zggpma3-tW6WdDMGUFFKopa3-nawyvasKFiQ9HRKkCEoVuyJfTvc1-rwvHjCMHZXcTh8uaSKMXcaDSGluI6XRJOSHymnKkqS2xZWprIbonA4iYgxh6BIR7oa1oTjal4yGBb0Fq9JwWtvB_RAT_8RoaHVQ9Fd9iHyHtBfhOs=w1024-h576-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/twqikRV4LBs_WT9hpP8h9bZk1w90B_FGsr6N7BBSyPQE8X2kmy2RHKravWsybqGARTRwGsTtMs8hJSpp2jKM8v5j8znF02-ocruan9_32H7YPZ1DKiGC25Yi3v3pB7dWWxF6tvN030bXzAS8xk9pIfk-Rcy5eXgBCcTnLyzKlIaiY5PLzr3gnbPa7iSM_cMnTtcNXOBHeDlyDWbanPIK7v4TR8U6ZWQj0VC8at9oNMraMjcQtkKY1TqYG8A-cFbFuNoggHDY5wiZnQm-lHh-wQa9iqIpp1me2C3MMrpatwwqXW1-KOyD4BXvFMXetQlzSUJ0F0cYlJ7E1kQh6RyhNCHSBuiOGx8z3tjlYOiRQHJK7ZskUZ9hADqCVwbJaDu-ncGNqjGD1p7L2u6s7F-C7i14Kx91Dyze92bF0a_qexOZotWy8TupO4YrGVwdTRseW21LWJTmgwF1C2eBoWLnefMT_RiDpGQCP8gQkVOR5IsvdwO6v9KqqATzcfSbSaRZ4udZ0fNIwH_8hn3D-z-pyrrzaI5Eb8rJGyoMZAg-e2U=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IB-u6vA5XDvWBE2aH4I885SAmHqOdShCYb6RD8gGc6zM04sNGRH9keNlJSidDCE3sENGOMqm23C25WizF9i7H-eTr4t5giCRgEa9IsHOrif7Fv-pejU4G0Ws1Id-jAEMZHmYgQChSgOnElPWCBYNQue4-eWpH-H2B4VjHGj5dbwgFe-HoIfYAfsGSTfK5fJKHnkyNmvluIkp6gbbYMaQuwhu2RPhFcCNe8p_QD3-CUClluvEiH1ODgN4QejWX1BSSFNykXU-vSogXNKNESm3EPIIHiLwCablsvZZVoPSRbsPC2F-08fgcH1munpq026sBZrViXJiMap6YlB7k5WdXH4pQM3hMcnRzgdqhDHAkpesH1u93BKOyCJrNO-9H2ut0hKrZ_9IS_USNzCsnsr33lRIi3SLznazPCoM5dPi3V93z3s4esSE20bogGLYooGJEwbK8giMaswbgVV0-90jfO63fEPan9SWJV45ejMLTlzr8J-e6o3dTDXzu5sCVJdROyHtTACw3hCK7DSuJ-o7d-ia6th3nXmyiW8gLte_6zc=w278-h156-no'),
(5, 'Jupiter', 67, 68911, 'Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth of that of the Sun, but is two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn (Uranus and Neptune are ice giants). Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94, bright enough to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.\r\n\r\n<p>Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, although helium only comprises about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet''s shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 67 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. The most recent probe to visit Jupiter was the Pluto-bound New Horizons spacecraft in late February 2007. The probe used the gravity from Jupiter to increase its speed. Future targets for exploration in the Jovian system include the possible ice-covered liquid ocean on the moon Europa.</p>', 165, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JIGIMS28ED_hrBGeGNGbp5kmV31NKekpL5juS1XKI2cEfup7WLLE3V4Zr15odmAf5J9zafaUHRH0QI0wF5euBfSyjmVzFUdstJG4Y2FcsYjZrGgxn5TiD1IGPO4IHsiVX1lqPUa7Yl8EXHBth6zwOwJCoAN4FmWmSP_HBgo7ZMK4CQpC_zofHc-XtDkf1Ol9KNk2rO2eSmn68bMcyN8TftaoRPOx4nQ7Fm9K_KuFiYaqw4tnR-Jo56GClAqkYyHgmCy8Qk4eMSIm4P0nicEK0oXdqV2gL_IF7vIPUwHk1DpJZd5N9eewHM0RMYK2dJWqjZ17uj1g5pORQGwv-3mMI7Atpvfmkjg3IDtiuX97LmWOOIkOQElrzrKq1VAqn63AFZmSWoMB5ghpEQFjFPzdaaPuZm5ANZqZb5Ig-ZqV31Yb0MEzLKRrBi5gU0zQa8TTl2wmts6q1VQ0SBbC1FY9Z_7w4eMhYRIBzNHyF7nfM4K_5NCuJU9NKFDpxIBo4y3UxZE901oOemJtKigHozKrJYuNELoWDh10TqrhcoSxvAI=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sMrGLqFP842CnNzF_7W7f8pQEB-KyrpHuiSBeNglmCaeSl4ZROmxkVWIXissrZdCAWtpzJ7sm1KFBVyX20z6Ae-3ccql6TOhAjK9U3KyJbVRQGeJNh5ldOJ96JU_Yy06ubvMb3iBKc9mrjXxXm5JzMlPr-nZIY4rcTtwIogFqyIc0aCHYrA6tO9RNyX9V3VnK3gqGZ2XDcP2ndR8UMKFMTdpNIVI_NJ8AMK4DhocDE3TyORViA0GXWnVk3gulfK1l1JX6pdIsk-qIQcrPZbgHLMrdfv11t0ZeRH_t0tw-iy7HsMdem894P_1tytHahGt-nDoLgSFq3ZS4-CzLoe4k-PvdIzPBcQ6QkuT0A9ZDTc7x8khqQLLyfUS-3sg7BuV6_uneycZdgNfbTQ9HcnAg_7S08pdoVN1zrlOIslZgaqZgDDwv_p0CiMtV_TtZwsG8k6BY0nW_wdCftNzQr9hxCChTiCk8JXATRmqere2zZgF1bB-ZwnNrq9xMD7Aimdaniaa5FsSECPW47kNDixKomuwrIBIbu4KvYZQKOzSSwU=w640-h530-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Qq0M8_Xz_ZtUC5AuErtUDEG1oVnstW1ouAwXUfNSr_bZnduIzcvq0G3mDyfn-WZpB2WRGLGjJbucJ-VnmuUM_3zoyjawce8E8LPZxbdfglczFMTai2Aj82fppD7Gs1b3QoDfvRgWdHdDdWvKyLIDOX1Roeg2hjJxf2GvD9Ee0RIoJXTJ9qXeiuF4qj-8VOwLqDrV4CjdLNeIYG-No2ejPwbM7f1Dnpn_84oHkmh7qe04PYXY0-xevCliaFadvAWMJ3WZwH9_bNLNbUUnm6UVJK3Riy8Fu5mwhe6EjcJ7mfnKMUwH7QDJdSs42RvtmpZEMH9XHIpch2TxxZ_C8V1Ia4E-OSXUIn2x4r4dRkz0S8x31WnJDx3Q-NIbpsZXvI5zVvQynb2ocZBFZS2yJ0k2FHZaof6kGCSLS53UrCtvwMnzgOL5eoeCI2okP_hjmXg3EnGF68diwF8PDPnaaU-BIjl_1OweUayKBgbP2ZafZmR-xup3_7glT69NrG-qVmmmMULG6L90nOhltjlczl7El-mhk_IIpeyJXQtYeoSSVNY=w1421-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sjf-FVd35BrJkTTP_nAmHC-eBcTXziOufGjcJB_yiGaxdUN1Q0llpL5RW7kewiofhpnJjx29-XYPf-oAdP5_zz5_OEkXoIlaRCak3YLImJo13AGLrvWIWsEHSjwx_4dnCOWk2zogMwEmoMdJUbqWupVuQADe9zl0P3zEduCVvcDEXycFcbD3G2F4kGl8Tdgy9fxyq6z0L22rrSd4YBFqEmTK6kwWTJHeK2I68i11Wytsi3Ptr3peziebcjgDfX3DAAyz09JydLoAZFimEpHySU62D62h_P-QdI3DMdlGCBy-MVaam482-2fZpPWmqp7JMod01r36wgNxvQspRtvK3SRz0kEDHbQys2Z9N-AOkOdKxNfTZeG3qLXrz98Yuh8rSkJCTUidPrwp-2h3-F8FWezYEAI6PSpD_-Xf99UmqBdfofLPmX3OyRv0szsjORIxd-A-xsyOzU2-6R_ndhm6wX_jssxOzfrrFN8slddJyLErBoPYRVeytX5VrAzBNoIps0qaoFKhK4NNyakHBZcy0vzhp_xzJb23o4OY-Wpnr2c=w800-h600-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4ukbKtVES9oY_pPmze2hlelaPGgiffSdG75KjEJFu2mCrWNJwN8EiNjdamux1dOwDvmkjrIRUQzXhQy6cleCbb7bZVh_i-KI26pBJ9seAqdofJLR_3gPXNPfBys2J2WX_aMfM8scgtWbtkeiRGXLesXtqZfzPACe3GembQsAcDrUadNsDnS69JO3ZLYWwV9eqwGUxJPakQUHfE0bveo5OZnHndpJaERLVn7SOyfcKnS3Ot2Q4AdIF0vBPUTNZlzUtE2my0eSW_Y3P6yMMfo7aG-bdBAVUJhpCQHM3iGfgZh1pic_wJfH1XgCDL05xY7f7DRe4bO9LpzS4djn8CVWQEwJTz-gQdFKvuvroOW0ofPwdsM4BTzkDSpr1_f-4_ZZVsepXNrC_Y8tZTuqP9nMT1jLjqKKHleAiVFfX-3floV6aQt1jCJ0nrIm3uPkaRfOa6Gdln-7du0O5qRISXkMRrd_a3iq7k8b1qkvrlDo_0POPDOzeRJJlmrF4yh4gHS18JhigBZsH0AcE_hFvVYHEPmHS56JoiVjLTCZVKQCzU0=w1421-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/H4usawCtsnTYg_rIBnQbzdkPU68ox0rakeenebn7jTlK04PbwhRGhMqlG-OYuRQcdusUjkIVQBU9HYN_0TyzlUMjXyo2ncb1PTW7umq1i9xdrpZB9_3_P7u4jgBKccTZ_jgppk02miHo84SP3cQ6HFHJ5UJyKLeIMvSI0Mop6c28TEvEYR1fg7ATqphe1rapqj86LUNovwvqVawMXyWGiPBKQCiHpky3sd_R95R14KBTHIdX7hAB5yNdgym2tE9au39BcQoolCQKxrat82KqZU-MSni7CqRC6rn8DRQ8niJosr4kW2fNklmzvd-ZmTqGY_d6N3qhDuekyBNIUSh-5ckWFQDHqqkJrw4mMfw3Ae6PWI5t-txroXAVSQtsDlpNewZ4HvVxxAfanIyj19cfZQwtqX_btpbbp3OhBLlGZUChPHBQ5v0NzHZeWMn5UzZRu4iU7OSOD7ebm991SeZ9T-mSTgSj5xebFmO7U2J-fxzzxMYJiYpqQMAcVso07cK3_vrVDKf8sCGHkM7vdq5Dk7QYrZsDZsgYLY4k7-_9qJQ=w278-h156-no'),
(6, 'Saturn', 62, 58232, 'Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture, its astronomical symbol represents the god''s sickle.\r\n\r\n<p>Saturn''s interior is probably composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally outside the Frenkel line a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn''s planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth''s, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn''s larger size. Saturn''s magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth the strength of Jupiter''s. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs and that is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. Sixty-two moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which fifty-three are officially named. This does not include the hundreds of moonlets comprising the rings. Titan, Saturn''s largest and the Solar System''s second largest moon, is larger than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.</p>', 134, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Uy8GdMVilutoagIh04jYyxgGG9yu6B9mi8Iq-SPYE6Z0COZkAUT-f2rrSLVAdUf5pOMbtzzQCwg5_tj9t1vy4WQodi2W2S5WOoBF6z_kSQXa1iiI-sXUDs7Jks1s24cZqzuB38Ur58D3jvVhUyykZI6jYXBzeWEKoP0koCfRlbmrK7kMbduSV8Eo9TxelzXWcD3VEsyANm_TSJnwDa6rvpSfFed7XYbTBYQO0q0gZburtQyN3_jJfq-uJcwcpYGB0suzLkcSHjOhhoJxhI00Jy63iwtaNorPPQ1zjOJoYnG47gx6TQY7LUwNefgE8VxGebjLcK-4SkpZenQ53TcAU-WiH8MAxFGWyE2Lpwk0ZodSKUfFO8T55N6BOsUy_tGifZkkHV7wfyKKUyAlRrd-HMstbF7yAESx0eJf0bC-N7W0cigmD00lW7cLXsCEp3xp_4EgUDwdzEs1kcrSuokMjhUNG_foJY7U03SVnoHXm4silqgyVggOz-xR5V3Bub_nITw-Cs196_ftRXp8jgYViBZs3v8q7iINlMk6rMPBef0=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pR6bj1Ebs4RMphcK8C-yjJJD39UBTBRM2TrUWu_7g0UC2dWUwW_-OfKe6ynMXKWBDhfOEkiinKglemFPuFyZIAUhEKtBbSpLUcZA_MyCdBjpI8G2LpuiVOgBYsTYuGPwpixJ592QG0K7BNEhLz_KUv4TsfhWBw2ZjkA47uZh0AhYFwP0uhl8rRheF9zn7BiOyjQ4JJicEZQ6s6L0qTXMQEBmvwGdBpfN8zTpVireE8z6WO5dhDnIJ_oHmtbxtHMfvt8kvwaMP_OlcmqRi2yaDgBG5ZoPq7jSGiiHBuoZ-OVRE_y7M-392lARW7Bq5nUWVDKnJE_nPMnqzT7yVEQJzXN6xpCJr-YsuvSufUMRMM2694O5J3Ilb_bRftG8rxkymLol_efZYg8Ch5vakagFe3DE6CW1KPJwRmeUweTxI-DxqShLNHpntxb9g3r7k-4UFSjEtMnIvlRnJcisFYFOeaaob-qJ_3sGLGIRQ6_AsBntOu_lQEI7KMBaZELzwAKk6aXv3cfpKUr06-Orl8jV4By5RVpUymTz01jYrUHYpT4=w500-h373-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VI8IbZlyYTT8vERO0rZWhVRdkENFkvQLMm4MqudRWE8Mjpp7uf12ySwnT9zPZD5x42wSPVpwtjohw_27Pr9ooWrbYaKU0Q74azAyI1JvA06QyC2yKg7sdd8tWN3qUhRU3h4iapEdUTmd1-PzYUyscUUyDui942USxU4dqMQW-buQ3dzO-8UCYugVZjMZVttyFy2IpA_Zg1RlEV4lnI4TOfEDj1vgNs-s8FxVy8qB10BW_BrpEHLwJaQCl_D0PiVdeIAtr7BlxoqTrvxnYZVLSiGhT0YtWO0klWt8Q4reb_yCAdf0MKfDTnyG3cFJz7002CjHdNFXCHNOeNO5WvjTnENHLv_IscltDtwNxQ3ulXHBXvR61SHR0J0sQA_Z_vmD7NqbOvJ76xImT5nx3ept5GG1Zsxd2btzhIeGuw0dYG1QvKYuSD9bd_6_KUSS4zCYD-fw3kEQBSdP3y5TraQeQmLW8vDUv163Nlif1jjREe7UJPtAl1WBWRuDLUSD36Do2jRFfexVozffWhzp1hn440V7cPUI54KV-Z0jYPOSKiM=w1191-h764-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IfydgqNEdPxod87rFKFIi9rsWhoXWjGAL2Llo9xDSH1XjWIaIWXWS3nwnZyii52Lp-MMdX9OqA_DSwcbHeRNWN6Q9fhW5XeHh144rHjhuVYzqEpW3oakXp87rTXYF_rINa38ldNlDhV36kXLRp4peS4c7nCUMK11mhCk3VXTed8oAgPVcxmOpDrgj0qseq3qjn77e7yeKsBHprnlrBKbGoQi3XDTIWDUuFTRhB7KfTD2AT8krOBial5Cn4UJmCLcu70ozSYJDxAfU484mRvqSS6UnismZ6jSJE93dhT9tjM9rN9w0DLJeGXxobcKSzVdMWz3R0T-rRFUXyRwy9SMITXUajj7aQwHk2tznkgJlgNVwR_G8iJX_6ou2btHOioX04P8lC2GQZtySZuidTn0cPRuwBzGScmYwXdbwj7tc12uMk4116pWOIhX0X3gVcjv5IwIDiTVnaCMBM-mboju25I7iSqkTPPE5ELLZeohvcbOSW3Q1urycQVutJn7W_6piL9DIPZzMooqaLoIgBcdSKV3SX-3l0-wmCvI1DH1cpE=w1072-h799-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/24hXUIco9LcrnWbYy67AvTVVad55A9WoVwzYHkJbor0C98mv8bCH0DgWUIdHuOp0hkHavSYytQDCfgIcmJh_ODl9mlG5frfmH3LosNiYTHzX0Vsa_Dsp5jvxwAgGMZaakasZeQqtWMGS2mshzQisqqAB7WvZ8uK_QS5WJmvZR1GeTELsLkRy2R41pjkqqpIHAnnMtlPJxZPZPT6HWaYlX7vMzFRF71io0BdWLZcGiToO0-M4ARG2T6mmnc4lgivENtEworDm6ElX9r2OOBjX9TJGTFZPGAgL8tXprtFBV5GxBCV6HVyEXhEm3t5cW8DX59p1UgpkW4cwyQ75iHSjXUy_A8nk3etYIRE3rAaSFOPv6lgbuRGUXqzYQUrTOJpEPfFpLQnWPHaJUVICdLZruGQnudtxejp8KsbfSSy04jufpEZaJfGECmhhPtFBz3UVn0oSEv69e3gFqcVjTKJDqPk3ITP7LqLiCDhx-XZ4Bxeig-RudTl5qQw74pBojnI71sqw9VdQW7IGrpG1R8CLjzdqJzCecX32jqNwZzoZ-2E=w1024-h602-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4iXG06k10z2u9Bxu2cydv2OzcozDinEwegIVD1lDFNIV7eSg9SwjsCSspcYDLyVI7VR-TV1Yc-RNZlWkFTQhQ-1fQr-MhECgtlhwilQc358lYzv8R2PPId3lyjuuQ7PCIzkMiJFcrB0exA7NHMtYxvt07zeXD6R-Ttq_VfFZ93eLusj5P0kgvKeYQ5XH3RWenPKzRA90ajgQg9L6XhVqnzKooXg-IVEUlKpg4YxKRl1wktlnHEDMEWaf6BXxsa5VrCMnLV4i95MZMu7SydRlnjHDVgu8xAXhBX6ZV5OYKfY1_V4BSRLIAIPHZ0PJTRz578cmX1Br4NciRDav4-WEpttcsH2pTJ-8mg_iVAYkgmxJwhTMtTw7gXX2SJ0aaakz1ArFS-1R06aI-tyapRj3mA4RX3w3LNeUbFnzJBZnz8j1t5-HhY21F2EYkogq9BrX0BO094dA96mxJurJ7tIKlq0wA1rYZAz9SBovABA_by8ogCZrUDzCxuWnrfMLYdH-_g1kPpFiec8voFj74bH3y0q2lI4hcg-xB0p1s01ar8=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/itXapeyQzvMEFHjAiVTlhMZ-m1MRKlDGXImS25iUDgCxWcLvVyO9pxcH4S-vNi3DWBWcbAVwNSpWlI_XHcAj9GfigRcZyjDenkbAF9ISouJ5-_oVHwv69BU1pVQZgGJ6D_iAOw_nV7jPOEdYjdyrR2tsfizWxoUN7KnZyDSJuQ0r6Ul6Xg9dDKh1Ja5iNXWuCLs22I4CyWkpqnW-14SWzpq2kmgzkGMHpsP8KXLZ2gqhv4OJXnhZZ3PmHX4rQtG1XJSn7B5JnwNw4aJ4c5IGsgfFLSywyjiGtdZSrWKfs5jiJav9snXpzSagl9UjspctR1q5UE9iAoeCcYPIfmwkrU9FfTA3p_AVPaQT5R9C04rRW1Ntvi223bmtKVsCCulgEabFf7CqrAgQYsu4xiZ1TYN32fOgbuByeTp-UVX8sum2mkw1MpZnp7qeORd11ILHHkpvVrkKHcNTra7IuRlT2DF3nPRYeV-HL7ypOTY5VsnLUh-Jw-TLwxdrT-WMUpyZ2XinAXTQXsJe4TslRwztV7dCh1rokwRAzuPWMofY4pw=w278-h156-no'),
(7, 'Uranus', 27, 25362, 'Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Therefore, astronomers increasingly place them in a separate category called "ice giants". Uranus''s atmosphere, although similar to Jupiter''s and Saturn''s in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, contains more "ices", such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224.2 °C), and has a complex, layered cloud structure, with water thought to make up the lowest clouds, and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.\r\n\r\n<p>Uranus is the only planet whose name is derived from a figure from Greek mythology, from the Latinized version of the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos. Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration among those of the planets because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its revolution about the Sun. Its north and south poles therefore lie where most other planets have their equators. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets. Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. The wind speeds on Uranus can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h, 560 mph).</p>', 76, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/16MBkTIItnOlnESLtJWFwI1fLfzxji5PzYFmEGYYmvmt_JvCGpEH6TSFt8n303HBXXFqvlmM9P1DH5Ckkh1Rqv25jt5V_f_me49pUFMVdceT67W_608kFZ5BAwR8gENnZMswdVxNKH0QV6JkCtU0uUAStFS4hfZ6G3q9ybR95gYbxoAtjASbKG730SWPbSiBH_IcUPIYu95n29-Oy-FpF_OG7kIK0Xdw1Br7toxc12m0PKJ3wjNiaPHEjud52bq7pvLb_YH0B_lUbN2zfIq8h0isiojuxakJqWd0F-RLkTY8gqW_wF7tUGB9ZRsXpaadjFvH_vzzfTCIqhyedCALrMidshAWV7tE3v0J-RQRLz4M7N5f42wy-ChZ-HhUrbsZAOeBmN2jEcT-eKThIAEMeG7CD1A9wnqXBDOndn-jF7W16VZs-HyUgvIlbsO_NAJwUm6bbBeyDuZuepYo6RVBoRUqYY3_sHM5U9nZRmWlZO-g7_pfAZXESswXaKYjqvAYDFdUoLYog4VNKPsVOaG3ts5tQNC8aSXEjcALsG5dGUo=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0I99V3Xe7wBozR-trHi8ghEQCFFD7yr4VK-WdODZ5mNyVY7JdjVhmLXGSySnAlzHZCOQTqETgyIqTyq60cEXF8Y7GsTjFkE6Dg7sYBCwVKgKNlD-Qh95h0CsjaktI76shcF1U8UmH-t3zCfKy1fN9M81x0aZkznJyjqoFXDgI6MjZqmBaDpjRKbNlzlZ5QNk-o-V8uyE82MxY-9U_Z5mAmFU2vwSUH6U79UbY5mUqBYnpGqWoIerAK25NJ_rb2-ziuQjQF0wk73wrfVIVjSrL344TAPY9OFKIXzEUM9WL4OSE3wwn_vq4GNDO3RO4LtJ9ruMh2XJXuNaO5RkxqcfmISKUtnLmqeM3mKZQrJHFeyyxx8dw8pERjV8kX2EL_YrnrrIaDmLGyRILo-IJlyuZAmV9UcsZB-DM33EmgKVJ4LfL9nnZXteaOcvPpj8Qfw-Qf6voRNtafgEXJum-LK0mlsEDJUhG_FAaR-JCLZb8sDZewGYZN7EVMs88L1gphLSOWg6aO-FGKQWLpaH4cY-qytbDR6oi7B-nyo7Jg1tGbM=w800-h600-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P5aruju0uwdnacgz0na9bBPzkNUQfSUrojGPguTNjo5dDvFk7_RJKavkPuuU0iUEbx7GRfjJBQ34IEKAqbbYxHcl76__PeMfPf8OkuSy17FQmd0oKQCBuI4ktn6ShvcRQBM11PbT5c5Em26IpwCfXaKAMcSna92OMgi1079gyrhRxj4rWXsnVUhx1O9MrEqsQeFKyt21AtOs0Fa5obIuD4nfc3-zdWf7ZFHod3QeiRKGGvkT0luD_d2ERS6cKz-A2eD1AAxNWr2JRTVa_kMq8yW0-0K9oapWeSCfMcILnyMWs8ioepSsvlliPWYvNwxSlV0-DE3ItiXrHdD5dJDuN6vGIJmauOnk7zsBQKstgWv0CfrE7CnOJw-jDwHh8XOif6a1rphIGqGV0jcuQnQPcOnuGGGeblXhqqtX3Ik2vxoBPrhFYf29hZ6hWkSrjC9bVPI3En1htgrD4jYY4IuBmfVm2Vp5okZ6kZ1Z1pg-hGfjew2pp3uAXDPV4JezDSWB5K3AZhI0Ogahk0mDLEMZ6xrnfYtDNENVOEE_nQJ290M=w1000-h744-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MAhby444-ne9rijbeyujJTVj1vN3RwdZfO6DdFGNvCq-lIo7nttHszGBD8CGfcZp2S-DVGwhSs1NWus60VQC69Al285t82iLj030XhbLVBR8p5RyjlvUnxxPVzqm2b10uTz0A26ADcMBUU6jqizzkokp-BQppicc5jc2V4UDIjUZp3J99a9ZIIMQeeRs2JgZlzbVdo8DlCOMnnFN_DjKw1gRN9sQCdUqned6IQFPhi39S3DI5n1ftjo2xpTzjp1uVP-pCHeQYVwz2m4DctFfZt0YN1UUYfVx_dGeZqucn8ulVkUPvC_ha5zxYrAty9lS35MOoeo2PUdl4ccmeBfztzSl4Fw12BXuhFH5hcZ8S-OPlj7DVdxDbkz5E_ZaINb7uOgbsHQgoAeJCJOscKfj8cre3s-GhP8NRlmOJmXKMr7yWkH9_Jq0mg_pqmLtKjySA7p8zayk7mpeD1rbVJNWZARs-79NM7Z2ofHUleJlsy0GGYZ0UAXveNBO0F60WTycm3cNQMhorR6HqLS6-nEfIBowq9oriHbz1NYjYf0aFxQ=w800-h500-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPzKVXUJ2V8UTDjHA9L_C31_4sUsHfqrfnzxeqIUEBDWLg4Db5iuZ0hk2purOcZDGMhXmlSyrJSt8UF2y3GhEIjGHaf2mPu6FYeuzFYiekOQpdxkUwkny0DsYS1xy5sebVfWDs2wrIKQNknCjkDR71fXuRdRHLXerG1oSZjIwk6JWaJc89kRJkaK57C864OmZ55kyq8TOZFmoh5xscvnaQ1lHkNhzXdWkdl4gg6dI9c0VXUgQ6DhALgdHKpVmyPNpdStdW7nNS1_eSowqA6Z33tPDGIEcCnGiSmTw3nYuaY2RqIjdbZpbihdhPl-cF6FCq8tYANwrib9qIJ4Nvl0ZZrfgAFzr7GIkGCi_YmV28xAcnbYNput1fxNPaqbeZcjNIqFVdFoqaJM4ESbskquDuHj6lAxpG1RAUxSRQsAiHNQNotfUZC_SM9aGjtabrhNSh1or6_4M77ojq2R0Jx99vVc2v2XYjrPe9Xn615YxwVt9AevbqBA6cQZkHOG2xdIXi6_1sCsD6XGYBYRA0xsgK8DOL7dxoyH7ZEdRcUyGCE=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hyDEu2w6HMQVwWvXHsL9zDbo1gdwfC-z8IATtZl-xF8cTgN7rnfNcMCyCXu60VzI3nYlUqhX9L821nPTwM5HiDex5F0aRQR-ZqQN5CGJGZdgduboyNNM4gvBFC5lwZXaTwQ2Ibqyn1XoVy3ngrS7HVwz_TmL4o4rixI2dl2fMkN0BPoN969shlSsfy0oXTYLe4i8q_aMi6R156NmQ_qCoe23ZuQcfsGpuktPDNtawY31rcupn5xTt-swuBgFJZUwmA23EckYZ1-dNHSE0_mJPhIiIM7RSmlQrNo9E7RLSDd7PCIG2hluwtyykMJu9Opm6uwTYU8oKTfTzvxspQnIa_2dG7FMcTCrsqBhi1C0FXgoF6L0-85z6atgS83jPxbkM-J1Gax_jPf8jhUnhE548KBfH4xjbz8LjxwjojN6_-3IPAQu6QPAQDWUiEOUdIC0k5ZFlzTmBy3Fh2-o5xYo9Dh7tqyJMoAsNcW8YI0Q4hyGdlSnBnUz9QbTIVXijQ1DBiDRUUeZ09kppW8aIgsj5VQC_m0odya5Vj_tpn3n5og=w278-h156-no'),
(8, 'Neptune', 14, 24622, 'Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Among the gaseous planets in the Solar System, Neptune is the most dense. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth, and not as dense as Neptune. Neptune orbits the Sun at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.50×10<sup>9</sup> km). Named after the Roman god of the sea, its astronomical symbol is ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune''s trident.\r\n\r\n<p>Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and was the first and only planet found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet''s remaining 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet''s distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. The advent of Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has allowed for more-detailed observations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neptune is similar in composition to Uranus, and both have compositions that differ from those of the larger gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Neptune''s atmosphere, like Jupiter''s and Saturn''s, is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen; it contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane. Astronomers sometimes categorise Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to emphasise this distinction. The interior of Neptune, like that of Uranus, is primarily composed of ices and rock. Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet''s blue appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune''s atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the 1989 Voyager 2 flyby, the planet''s southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 kilometres per hour (580 m/s; 1,300 mph). Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune''s outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C). Temperatures at the planet''s centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C). Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled "arcs"), which may have been detected during the 1960s but was indisputably confirmed only in 1989 by Voyager 2.</p>', 72, 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lN_Ssftg23exzZnZAltJCfmBRld7mYK5YtMvheJUzOacSwQuOIy3Um9abWPpmEycbqdjhOax6ceXub8TvpHf82fKAWiEGTLum1CqQUlsIDH2kjNNMEFqRoK-C8-j3_DRvsCUZciKt5sGsddGeMu1IKDfNv6wQkXb1rAx_LkVBUlJ-vzRgWRAkm-_887cTJRWOe1mfwHL8B0N3jb_7D1vZUldBk06KttoDkVuAoBQ_zM2qRX4fE4X8QRtgpzlGUmC2N4fWprTUY8ZOL35TUTSP0RiL7Wv_6h5CoJ9T5Y9LFPB5XTvJYvMUm8Z51Swh9Ffaj6QKMXARPdLCeb-hfiUWssZpA4_oYeHZuB3npjEcl4N7OPxl6TOf8gVU0alK2MNpWN665ZAaoGsXMmvosO5vHnooGZJRBGTujhfQMJ_9eyI5N5EKtWnTScOuG7ywRVRx3xeR6vuXOj64PuQ66h5JqlYJ716JYPhxlW4miW7rOj3aLMQqn7YkpdOkvkDHzpj-z8N4ppQXLgZdYgCjDFm2Ue-y9gniFw-nX5tioslfeM=w198-h111-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SNA5ZBKSH6ViLXOxmETblV5k27G6hhM8QVMPv5xuF-_AlR-8odhc6SvNZBh7102rOx_JBh4Wn-QEGwf_yt8FQRr5LhRT83T5O3HeFVtFYxT8A0FExJpJVoDRo0b3NpJtfYmUY8BgIi47A2cYY1F5I0gT1K0DcwhbuNh2NiNyViLfvbEOBgTMnmUVQLziisl6bSgxBVfi6Ds_UgFMJxSXqcOaszAO9TiXKBk-Z5nFPM3aADEbiOJZ21cyeosaw4PeFYa2tRVk1OE5ev2twotuBQQmwDLOHBfFuWnDpTt05UN01cBrAJU2fSF2eZhzjnfLENWXkTvAssQ6vstOrD2vyuyRwGiYYqee63Z0nmT2UBx5V-Xgn_QVXr_vo36jWvGB1t1TdVTz6qnPnTC-b6xVXgNC8e6sjCs5YePL9JgYXfRnhwgZog0YhtQt5bcnQHEep_7nGB2lbLBiHmUhh9k3myMYHi97WOS5l0cn1_EBpegtiBBdXXAmZ8wWJrln_2NLSWvZCAshA2GaLdeEtkc1IhwosYSfmHv0H9gf9_v3cLo=w1065-h799-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WUhYSY0z0G_fKZXWPWSiq0oiW1ApQrRCKBC04IZpWsh2LRtMj4fMW5UM7q0EPP6m_FrBVFaU1za75h3Wf_RxzYP8dH0ZW9ZRKWQ7yax1Vtzg_6qoIldc7-XVNaaUHG4I_sYhVnAKcJcS70gJy-xYA6k6gnX2y6YifhzfHted3XegbYBIDB3be23wz5cpgRO77fUVeks4ywuGy_V4RCxoup5OPjCHjz5SitWA8lmqctghXjw6_It5pGwiEq3FBAD5dt9XPHVJF8BbT2L0vipzdd0IisODsyfMn0XKW4z_fFzMl0bEpzXWPKwm6Az_4XQlG3bLJIqkbJYDVRUe7rKx6CdHect0nDzEy7mhtyLuCj9czD9Vd46QLgV2jM0UVQLckihu0MCbxfisGw_CHtZlwmYFiQFhPUf-Ll39Fnftt5cXjgCIm2KMXiioWXOBl_yX7KcVz88iLN4tHwGvM6b3Bkm80Ln0FThQFznXXlXPncom5d7jV4HawZzCELrvF4dAZ8uUmjkSn7jvDQ_ISRnfmrAp35RtwMsDSE8FAeD_yRg=w400-h225-no', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0jeMPFV62qOjiA3j9FC4ihociPp-G2RtMFe3-GJll9QEagWvyU1v2bXortLqbzRQaLEhZ517N8cu5pbghkWWM6E7pawNMuI6NOA3SQnenQy_qIQIUvXNnNGtw-omM1pZzCeChEMN-wRxUNOlEL-83RmXa-5Dq7J3WpGSoVLOiIRUbQEEQKrhxuMFOe7Lp1_3lPAhiNMxNB29nvjq--ocGdmjEsioYKyb3bSiaRbBfwZxaQXLNlYrShany1ct9RN9gwaA_6IXXSESBcMOZfGxsCYkJeO1D6QMZZuzB9iN4QByL6ooCSRW5kZd318K7c83OoZYyy5h0uuCvtdOT_TFl8EkibHYJwLoRrrGw-N0ejivyZ76MBIpkxIhbzA9_GguZ84ARP23WcfNTBvvl5rFVd2FMKgtPihFRfiv9gYlNORit1GY7xrevNn7aUV1cnHidVCVJ7HeS5pGpZbyBr1ff6papp-tT0NHEcE10GORM_GFcXIha9OOfJ4x1XryrjgpSj0etapKwncWvKrfWxJ7LQ5TfPb6U9rKcMJiyDujfY=w278-h156-no'),

It orbits its host along with another planet, Kepler-70c, both of which orbit very close to their host star. Kepler-70b completes one orbit around its star in just 5.76 hours, one of the shortest orbital periods of any exoplanetary system yet discovered, only second to PSR 1719-14 b with a period of 2.2 hours.

(12, 'Kepler-78b', 0, 7140, '<p>Kepler-78b (formerly known as KIC 8435766 b) is an exoplanet orbiting around the star Kepler-78. At the time of its discovery, it was the known exoplanet most similar to Earth in terms of mass, radius and mean density.</p>\r\n<p>The planet was discovered in 2013 by analyzing data from Kepler space telescope. The planet was found not only transiting the star, but its occultation and reflected light from the parent star due to orbital phases were also detected. It did not have Kepler object of interest designation at first as the automatic data analysis missed this planet due to its short period.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-78b is 69% more massive than Earth and 20% larger. Two independent teams were involved in pioneering work to estimate the mass of the planet. The estimates were made possible because Kepler-78b''s gravity causes a "wobble" in the orbit of the host star. While the method has been used to characterize gas giants, ordinarily it is hard to estimate the mass of Earth-sized exoplanets because their gravity is too weak to produce a visible influence on their stars. In this case, the planet''s orbit is so close to its star that its gravitational influence has a detectable effect.</p>\r\n<p>One team, led by Francesco Pepe, used the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher-North (HARPS-N) spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in the Canary Islands to estimate that the planet has a mass 1.86 times that of the Earth and a radius 1.16 times. The other, led by Andrew Howard of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, used data from the High Resolution Eschelle Spectrometer on the Keck 1 Telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to estimate the mass as 1.69 times that of the Earth and the radius as 1.2 times. Both estimates put the planet''s density at about 5.5 grams per cubic centimetre, equivalent to that of the Earth and possibly indicative of a rock-iron composition like Earth''s. The iron core could build up to 40% of the planet mass.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-78b is most similar to larger high-density, hot exoplanets like Kepler-10b, Kepler-36b and CoRoT-7b.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-78b orbits around the parent star in an 8.5-hour orbit. It reflects 20% to 60% of the starlight it receives. Due to its extremely close solar orbit, about 40 times closer to its star than Mercury is to the Sun, the planet''s surface is estimated to be at a temperature of 2,300 K (2,030 °C; 3,680 °F) to 3,100 K (2,830 °C; 5,120 °F). This temperature is high enough to have stripped the planet of any stable atmosphere, but the liquid and solid portions of the planet should be stable. According to Francesco Pepe, one of the astronomers involved with the discovery, the planet may be Earth-sized but "it can be imagined like a lava planet rather than an Earth-like planet."</p>\r\n<p>The acceleration of gravity on the planet surface is estimated to be ~11 m/s<sup>2</sup>, slightly larger than Earth''s.\r\n<p>According to CFA astronomer Dimitar Sasselov, "this lava world is an abomination. There’s no physical way a small world, only 20 percent larger than Earth, could have evolved in that location and there’s no known mechanism that could have transported it there. But one thing that is certain, it can’t stay roasting in that hellish orbit for long; it’s destined to get swallowed by its star very soon".

Kepler-10 was targeted by NASA''s Kepler spacecraft, as it was seen as the first star identified by the Kepler mission that could be a possible host to a small, transiting exoplanet. The star is slightly less massive, slightly larger, and slightly cooler than the Sun; at an estimated 10.4 billion years in age, Kepler-10 is almost 2.6 times the age of the Sun. Kepler-10 is host to a planetary system made up of at least two planets. Kepler-10b, the first undeniably rocky planet, was discovered in its orbit after eight months of observation and announced on January 10, 2011. The planet orbits its star closely, completing an orbit every 0.8 days, and has a density similar to that of iron. The second planet, Kepler-10c, was confirmed on May 23, 2011, based on follow-up observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The data shows it has an orbital period of 42.3 days and has a radius more than double that of Earth, but a higher density, making it the largest and most massive rocky planet discovered as of June 2014.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-10 was named because it was the tenth planetary system observed by the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA satellite designed to search for Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in front of, their host stars with respect to Earth. The transit slightly dims the host star; this periodic dimming effect is then noted by Kepler. After eight months of observation ranging from May 2009 to January 2010, the Kepler team established Kepler-10b as the first rocky exoplanet discovered by the Kepler satellite. Kepler-10 was the first Kepler-targeted star suspected of having a small planet in orbit. Because of that, verifying Kepler''s discovery was prioritized by telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The discovery was successfully verified. Although there had been many potentially rocky exoplanets discovered in the past, Kepler-10b was the first definitively rocky planet to have been discovered.</p>\r\n<p>The discovery of Kepler-10b was announced to the public at a winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 10, 2011 in Seattle. On May 23, 2011, the existence of Kepler-10c was confirmed at the 218th AAS meeting in Boston.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-10 is a G-type star, like the Sun. With a mass of 0.895 (± 0.06) Msun and a radius of 1.056 (± 0.021) Rsun, the star is approximately 10% smaller than and 5% wider than the Sun. The metallicity of Kepler-10, as measured in [Fe/H] (the amount of iron in the star), is -0.15 (± 0.04); this means that Kepler-10 is about 70% as metal-rich as the Sun. Metallicity tends to play a large role in the formation of planets, determining if they form, and what kind of planet they will form. In addition, Kepler-10 is estimated to be 11.9 billion years old and to have an effective temperature of 5627 (± 44) K; To compare, the Sun is younger and hotter, with an age of 4.6 billion years and an effective temperature of 5778 K.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-10 is located at a distance of 173 (± 27) parsecs from the Earth, which equates to approximately 564 light years. Also, Kepler-10''s apparent magnitude, or brightness as seen from Earth, is 10.96; it therefore cannot be seen with the naked eye.</p>\r\n<p>Per the usual exoplanet nomenclature, the first planet discovered to be orbiting Kepler-10 is called Kepler-10b. Announced in 2011, it was the first rocky planet identified outside the Solar system. The planet has a mass that is 3.33±0.49 times that of Earth''s and a radius that is 1.47<sup>+0.03</sup><sub>−0.02</sub> times that of Earth. The planet orbits Kepler-10 at a distance of 0.01684 AU every 0.8375 days; this can be compared to the orbit and orbital period of planet Mercury, which circles the Sun at a distance of 0.3871 AU every 87.97 days. Because the planet orbits so closely to its star, its eccentricity is virtually zero. It, thus, has an extremely circular orbit.</p>\r\n<p>Kepler-10c was also discovered by NASA''s Kepler Mission, the second exoplanet found to orbit Kepler-10. Radial-velocity measurements of the body suggest that it has a mass of 17.2±1.9 Earth masses and a radius of 2.35 Earth radii, making it the largest known rocky planet as of 2014. Kepler-10c would orbit Kepler-10 at a distance of 0.24 AU every 45.29 days.</p>', 5708, '/resources/images/planets/kepler10planet.jpg', '', '/resources/images/planets/kepler20e/kepler10Main.jpg', '/resources/images/planets/kepler20e/kepler10Small.jpg'),
(14, 'HD 209458b (Osiris)', 0, 93029.85, '<p>HD 209458 b (sometimes though unofficially named Osiris) is an extrasolar planet that orbits the solar analog HD 209458 in the constellation Pegasus, some 150 light-years from the Solar System. The radius of the planet''s orbit is 7 million kilometres, about 0.047 astronomical units, or one eighth the radius of Mercury''s orbit. This small radius results in a year that is 3.5 Earth days long and an estimated surface temperature of about 1,000 °C (about 1,800 °F). Its mass is 220 times that of Earth (0.69 Jupiter masses) and its volume is some 2.5 times greater than that of Jupiter. The high mass and great volume of HD 209458 b indicate that it is a gas giant.</p>\r\n<p>HD 209458 b represents a number of milestones in extraplanetary research. It was the first of many categories:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a transiting extrasolar planet</li>\r\n<li>the first planet detected through more than one method</li>\r\n<li>an extrasolar planet known to have an atmosphere</li>\r\n<li>an extrasolar planet observed to have an evaporating hydrogen atmosphere</li>\r\n<li>an extrasolar planet found to have an atmosphere containing oxygen and carbon</li>\r\n<li>one of the first two extrasolar planets to be directly observed spectroscopically</li>\r\n<li>the first extrasolar gas giant to have its superstorm measured</li>\r\n<li>the first planet to have its orbital speed measured, determining its mass directly.</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>Based on the application of new, theoretical models, as of April 2007, it is alleged to be the first extrasolar planet found to have water vapor in its atmosphere.\r\nIn July, 2014, NASA announced finding very dry atmospheres on three exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b) orbiting Sun-like stars.\r\nSpectroscopic studies first revealed the presence of a planet around HD 209458 on November 5, 1999. Astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope that they might observe a dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star''s face. This would require the planet''s orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after the discovery, separate teams, one led by David Charbonneau including Timothy Brown and others, and the other by Gregory W. Henry, were able to detect a transit of the planet across the surface of the star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet. On September 9 and 16, 1999, Charbonneau''s team measured a 1.7% drop in HD 209458''s brightness, which was attributed to the passage of the planet across the star. On November 8, Henry''s team observed a partial transit, seeing only the ingress. Initially unsure of their results, the Henry group decided to rush their results to publication after overhearing rumors that Charbonneau had successfully seen an entire transit in September. Papers from both teams were published simultaneously in the same issue of the Astrophysical Journal. Each transit lasts about three hours, during which the planet covers about 1.5% of the star''s face.</p>\r\n<p>The star had been observed many times by the Hipparcos satellite, which allowed astronomers to calculate the orbital period of HD 209458 b very accurately at 3.524736 days.</p>\r\nSpectroscopic analysis had shown that the planet had a mass about 0.69 times that of Jupiter. The occurrence of transits allowed astronomers to calculate the planet''s radius, which had not been possible for any previously known exoplanet, and it turned out to have a radius some 35% larger than Jupiter''s.\r\nOn March 22, 2005, NASA released news that infrared light from the planet had been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet. This was done by subtracting the parent star''s constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited in front of the star and was eclipsed behind it, providing a measure of the light from the planet itself. New measurements from this observation determined the planet''s temperature as at least 750 °C (1300 °F). The circular orbit of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.\r\nOn February 21, 2007, NASA and Nature released news that HD 209458 b was one of the first two extrasolar planets to have their spectra directly observed, the other one being HD 189733 b. This was long seen as the first mechanism by which extrasolar but non-sentient life forms could be searched for, by way of influence on a planet''s atmosphere. A group of investigators led by Jeremy Richardson of NASA''s Goddard Space Flight Center spectrally measured HD 209458 b''s atmosphere in the range of 7.5 to 13.2 micrometres. The results defied theoretical expectations in several ways. The spectrum had been predicted to have a peak at 10 micrometres which would have indicated water vapor in the atmosphere, but such a peak was absent, indicating no detectable water vapor. Another unpredicted peak was observed at 9.65 micrometres, which the investigators attributed to clouds of silicate dust, a phenomenon not previously observed. Another unpredicted peak occurred at 7.78 micrometres, which the investigators did not have an explanation for. A separate team led by Mark Swain of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory reanalyzed the Richardson et al. data, and had not yet published their results when the Richardson et al. article came out, but made similar findings.</p>\r\n<p>On 23 June 2010, astronomers announced they have measured a superstorm (with windspeeds of up to 7000 km/h) for the first time in the atmosphere of HD 209458 b. The very high-precision observations done by ESO’s Very Large Telescope and its powerful CRIRES spectrograph of carbon monoxide gas show that it is streaming at enormous speed from the extremely hot day side to the cooler night side of the planet. The observations also allow another exciting “first”—measuring the orbital speed of the exoplanet itself, providing a direct determination of its mass.\r\nAs of August 2008, the most recent calculation of HD 209458 b''s Rossiter–McLaughlin effect and so spin-orbit angle was that of Winn in 2005. This is −4.4 ± 1.4 degrees.\r\nIt had been previously hypothesized that hot Jupiters particularly close to their parent star should exhibit this kind of inflation due to intense heating of their outer atmosphere. Tidal heating due to its orbit''s eccentricity, which may have been more eccentric at formation, may also have played a role over the past billion years.\r\nThe atmosphere is at a pressure of one bar at an altitude of 1.29 Jupiter radii above the planet''s center.</p>\r\n<p>Where the pressure is 33±5 millibars, the atmosphere is clear (probably hydrogen) and its Rayleigh effect is detectable. At that pressure the temperature is 2200±260 K.</p>\r\n<p>Observations by the orbiting Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope initially limited the planet''s albedo (or reflectivity) below 30%, making it a surprisingly dark object. (The geometric albedo has since been measured to 3.8 ± 4.5%.) In comparison, Jupiter has a much higher albedo of 52%. This would suggest that HD 209458 b''s upper cloud deck is either made of less reflective material than is Jupiter''s, or else has no clouds and Rayleigh-scatters incoming radiation like Earth''s dark ocean. Models since then have shown that between the top of its atmosphere and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, there exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. This implies an outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud; usually thought to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides like M dwarf stars ("pM planets"), but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The Rayleigh-scattering heated hydrogen rests at the top of the stratosphere; the absorptive portion of the cloud deck floats above it at 25 millibars.\r\nSurrounding that level, on November 27, 2001 the Hubble Space Telescope detected sodium, the first planetary atmosphere outside the Solar System to be measured. This detection was predicted by Sara Seager in late 2001. The core of the sodium line runs from pressures of 50 millibar to a microbar. This turns out to be about a third the amount of sodium at HD 189733 b.</p>\r\n<p>In 2003–4, astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to discover an enormous ellipsoidal envelope of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen around the planet that reaches 10,000 K. The hydrogen exosphere extends to a distance R<sub>H</sub>=3.1 R<sub>J</sub>, much larger than the planetary radius of 1.32 R<sub>J</sub>. At this temperature and distance, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of particle velocities gives rise to a significant ''tail'' of atoms moving at speeds greater than the escape velocity. The planet is estimated to be losing about 100–500 million (1–5×10<sup>8</sup>) kg of hydrogen per second. Analysis of the starlight passing through the envelope shows that the heavier carbon and oxygen atoms are being blown from the planet by the extreme "hydrodynamic drag" created by its evaporating hydrogen atmosphere. The hydrogen tail streaming from the planet is approximately 200,000 kilometres long, which is roughly equivalent to its diameter.</p>\r\n<p>It is thought that this type of atmosphere loss may be common to all planets orbiting Sun-like stars closer than around 0.1 AU. HD 209458 b will not evaporate entirely, although it may have lost up to about 7% of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5 billion years. It may be possible that the planet''s magnetic field may prevent this loss, as the exosphere would become ionized by the star, and the magnetic field would contain the ions from loss.\r\nOn April 10, 2007, Travis Barman of the Lowell Observatory announced evidence that the atmosphere of HD 209458 b contained water vapor. Using a combination of previously published Hubble Space Telescope measurements and new theoretical models, Barman found strong evidence for water absorption in the planet''s atmosphere. His method modeled light passing directly through the atmosphere from the planet''s star as the planet passed in front of it. However, this hypothesis is still being investigated for confirmation.</p>\r\n<p>Barman drew on data and measurements taken by Heather Knutson, a student at Harvard University, from the Hubble Space Telescope, and applied new theoretical models to demonstrate the likelihood of water absorption in the atmosphere of the planet. The planet orbits its parent star every three and a half days, and each time it passes in front of its parent star, the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the atmosphere absorbs light passing from the star directly through the atmosphere in the direction of Earth.</p>\r\n<p>According to a summary of the research, atmospheric water absorption in such an exoplanet renders it larger in appearance across one part of the infrared spectrum, compared to wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Barman took Knutson''s Hubble data on HD 209458 b, applied to his theoretical model, and allegedly identified water absorption in the planet''s atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p>On April 24, the astronomer David Charbonneau, who led the team that made the Hubble observations, cautioned that the telescope itself may have introduced variations that caused the theoretical model to suggest the presence of water. He hoped that further observations would clear the matter up in the following months. As of April 2007, further investigation is being conducted.</p>\r\n<p>On October 20, 2009, researchers at JPL announced the discovery of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane in the atmosphere.\r\nIn 2014, a magnetic field around HD 209458 b was inferred from the way hydrogen was evaporating from the planet. It is the first (indirect) detection of a magnetic field on an exoplanet. The magnetic field is estimated to be about one tenth as strong as Jupiter''s.</p>\r\n', 1130, '/resources/images/planets/osirisplanet.jpg', '', '/resources/images/planets/osiris/osirisMain.jpg', '/resources/images/planets/osiris/osirisSmall.jpg'),
(15, 'HD 189733b', 0, 78420.718, '<p>HD 189733 b is an extrasolar planet approximately 63 light-years away from the Solar System in the constellation of Vulpecula, the Fox. The planet was discovered orbiting the star HD 189733 A on October 5, 2005, when astronomers in France observed the planet transiting across the face of the star. With a mass 13% higher than that of Jupiter, HD 189733 b orbits its host star once every 2.2 days at an orbital speed of 152.5 kilometres per second (341,000 mph), making it a hot Jupiter with poor prospects for life as we know it. Being the closest transiting hot Jupiter to Earth, HD 189733 b is a subject for extensive atmospheric examination. HD 189733 b was the first extrasolar planet for which a thermal map was constructed, to be detected through polarimetry, to have its overall colour determined (deep blue), to have a transit detected in x-ray spectrum and to have carbon dioxide detected in its atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p>In July, 2014, NASA announced finding very dry atmospheres on three exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b) orbiting Sun-like stars.\r\nOn October 6, 2005, a team of astronomers announced the discovery of transiting planet HD 189733 b. The planet was then detected using Doppler spectroscopy. Real-time radial velocity measurements detected the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect caused by the planet passing in front of its star before photometric measurements confirmed that the planet was transiting. In 2006, a team led by Drake Deming announced a detection of strong infrared thermal emission from the transiting extrasolar planet HD 189733 b, by measuring the flux decrement (decrease of total light) during its prominent secondary eclipse (when the planet passes behind the star).</p>\r\n<p>The mass of the planet is estimated to be 13% larger than Jupiter''s, with the planet completing an orbit around its host star every 2.2 days and an orbital speed of 152.5 km/s.\r\nOn February 21, 2007, NASA released news that the Spitzer Space Telescope had measured detailed spectra from both HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b. The release came simultaneously with the public release of a new issue of Nature containing the first publication on the spectroscopic observation of the other exoplanet, HD 209458 b. A paper was submitted and published by the Astrophysical Journal Letters. The spectroscopic observations of HD 189733 b were led by Carl Grillmair of NASA''s Spitzer Science Center.\r\nIn 2008, a team of astrophysicists managed to detect and monitor the planet''s visible light using polarimetry, the first such success. This result was further improved by the same team in 2011. They found that the planet albedo is significantly larger in blue light than in the red, most probably due to Rayleigh scattering and molecular absorption in the red. The blue colour of the planet was subsequently confirmed in 2013, making HD 189733 the first planet to have its overall colour determined by two different techniques.</p>\r\n<p>The blueness of the planet may be the result of Rayleigh scattering. In mid January 2008, spectral observation during the planet''s transit using that model found that if molecular hydrogen exists, it would have an atmospheric pressure of 410 ± 30 mbar of 0.1564 solar radii. The Mie approximation model also found that there is a possible condensate in its atmosphere, magnesium silicate (MgSiO3) with a particle size of approximately 10<sup>−2</sup> to 10<sup>−1</sup> μm. Using both models, the planet''s temperature would be between 1340 to 1540 K. The Rayleigh effect is confirmed in other models, and by the apparent lack of a cooler, shaded stratosphere below its outer atmosphere.\r\nIn July 2013, NASA reported the first observations of planet transit studied in X-ray spectrum. It was found that the planet''s atmosphere blocks three times more x-rays than visible light.\r\nIn March 2010, transit observations using HI Lyman-alpha found that this planet is evaporating at a rate of 1-100 gigagrams per second. This indication was found by detecting the extended exosphere of atomic hydrogen. HD 189733 b is the second planet after HD 209458 b for which atmospheric evaporation has been detected.\r\nThis planet exhibits one of the largest photometric transit depth (amount of the parent star''s light blocked) of extrasolar planets so far observed, approximately 3%. The apparent longitude of ascending node of its orbit is 16 degrees +/- 8 away from north-south in our sky. It and HD 209458 b were the first two planets to be directly spectroscopically observed. The parent stars of these two planets are the brightest transiting-planet host stars, so these planets will continue to receive the most attention by astronomers. Like most hot Jupiters, this planet is thought to be tidally locked to its parent star, meaning it has a permanent day and night.</p>\r\n<p>The planet is not oblate, and has neither satellites with greater than 0.8 the radius of Earth nor a ring system like that of Saturn.</p>\r\n<p>The atmosphere was at first predicted "pL class", lacking a temperature-inversion stratosphere; like L dwarfs which lack titanium and vanadium oxides.Follow-up measurements, tested against a stratospheric model, yielded inconclusive results. Atmospheric condensates form a haze 1000 km above the surface as viewed in the infrared. A sunset viewed from that surface would be red. Sodium and potassium signals were predicted by Tinetti 2007. First obscured by the haze of condensates, sodium was eventually observed at three times the concentration of HD 209458 b''s sodium layer. HD 189733 is also the first extrasolar planet confirmed to have carbon dioxide in its atmosphere.\r\nIn 2007, the Spitzer space telescope was used to map the planet''s temperature emissions. The planet+star system was observed for 33 consecutive hours, starting when only the night side of the planet was in view. Over the course of one-half of the planet''s orbit, more and more of the day side came into view. A temperature range of 973 ± 33 K to 1,212 ± 11 K was discovered, indicating that the absorbed energy from the parent star is distributed fairly evenly through the planet''s atmosphere. Interestingly, the region of peak temperature was offset 30 degrees east of the substellar point, as predicted by theoretical models of hot Jupiters taking into account a parameterized day to night redistribution mechanism.\r\nScientists at the University of Warwick determined that it has winds of up to 8,700 km/h (5,400 mph) blowing from the day side to the night side. NASA released a brightness map of the surface temperature of HD 189733 b; it is the first map ever published of an extra-solar planet.\r\nOn July 11, 2007, a team led by Giovanna Tinetti published the results of their observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope concluding there is solid evidence for significant amounts of water vapor in the planet''s atmosphere. Follow-up observations made using the Hubble Space Telescope confirm the presence of water vapor, neutral oxygen and also the organic compound methane. Later, Very Large Telescope observations also detected the presence of carbon monoxide on the day side of the planet. It is currently unknown how the methane originated as the planet''s high 700 °C temperature should cause the water and methane to react, replacing the atmosphere with carbon monoxide.\r\nWhile transiting the system also clearly exhibits the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, the shifting in photospheric spectral lines caused by the planet occulting a part of the rotating stellar surface. Due to its high mass and close orbit the parent star has a very large semi-amplitude (K), the "wobble" in the star''s radial velocity, of 205 m/s.</p>\r\n<p>The Rossiter–McLaughlin effect allows the measurement of the angle between the planet''s orbital plane and the equatorial plane of the star. These are well aligned. By analogy with HD 149026 b, the formation of the planet was peaceful and probably involved interactions with the protoplanetary disc. A much larger angle would have suggested a violent interplay with other protoplanets.</p>', 1117, '/resources/images/planets/hd189733bplanet.jpg', '', '/resources/images/planets/hd189733b/hd189733bMain.jpg', '/resources/images/planets/hd189733b/hd189733bSmall.jpg'),
(16, 'WASP-12b', 0, 126107.13, '<p>WASP-12b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star WASP-12, discovered by the SuperWASP planetary transit survey. Its discovery was announced on April 1, 2008. Due to its extremely close orbit to its star, it has one of the lowest densities for exoplanets (''inflated'' by the flux of energy from the star). The planet takes only a little over a day to orbit the star, in contrast to 365 days for the Earth to orbit the Sun. Its distance from the star (approximately 2,115,000 miles) is only 1/44 the Earth’s distance from the Sun, with an eccentricity the same as Jupiter''s. On 3 December 2013, scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope reported detecting water in the atmosphere of the exoplanet.</p>\r\n<p>In July, 2014, NASA announced finding very dry atmospheres on three exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b) orbiting sun-like stars.\r\nThe planet is so close to WASP-12 that the star''s tidal forces are distorting it into an egg shape and pulling away its atmosphere at a rate of about 10<sup>−7</sup> M<sub>J</sub> (about 189 quadrillion tonnes) per year.

The observations have confirmed predictions published in Nature in February 2009 by Peking University''s Shu-lin Li. The planet''s atmosphere has ballooned to be nearly three times the radius of Jupiter, while the planet itself has 40% more mass than Jupiter.\r\nRecent evidence indicates that WASP-12b has an enhanced carbon-to-oxygen ratio, significantly higher than that of the Sun, indicating that it is a carbon-rich gas giant. The C/O ratio compatible with observations is about 1, while the solar value is 0.54. The C/O ratios suggest that carbon-rich planets may have formed in the star system. One of the researchers behind that study commented that "with more carbon than oxygen, you would get rocks of pure carbon, such as diamond or graphite".</p>\r\n<p>The published study states: "Although carbon-rich giant planets like WASP-12b have not been observed, theory predicts myriad compositions for carbon-dominated solid planets.

These remarks have led the media to pick up on the story, some even calling WASP-12b a "diamond planet".</p>\r\n<p>The carbon content of the planet is located within its atmosphere, in the form of carbon monoxide and methane.
